#### Known History

Ralofir Fallbreeze was a hero of unparalleled skill and valor, known for his unmatched swordsmanship and unshakeable sense of justice. He and Elkian Sageheart, his closest companion, became legendary figures through countless acts of heroism. Together, they ventured into dangerous lands, saved villages from ruin, and fought against monstrous threats. Wherever darkness rose, Ralofir and Elkian were there to stand against it.

Their most dangerous quest was a mission to confront Markul, a necromancer feared across the land for his mastery of undead magic. Alongside two companions, Ralofir and Elkian journeyed to Markul’s fortress, facing terrible horrors to reach the heart of the necromancer's lair.

In the climactic battle, Ralofir faced Markul head-on. His courage and skill allowed the group to overcome the necromancer, but Markul’s dying curse struck Ralofir down. According to the tales passed down through generations, Ralofir died a hero, sacrificing himself to rid the world of one of its greatest evils. His body was never recovered, but his legacy as a fearless protector remains.

Heartbroken by the loss of his closest friend, Elkian Sageheart vowed to carry on in Ralofir's name. Determined to prevent such darkness from rising again, Elkian threw himself into new adventures, fighting tirelessly to protect the innocent. However, even a hero cannot be everywhere at once.

Realizing the need for others to take up the mantle of justice, Elkian eventually founded the Adventurers’ Guild, a place where heroes from all over the world could train and grow. Though Ralofir never saw the guild’s founding, his memory lives on in the organization’s values of courage, honor, and protection.

Today, the guild Elkian created thrives, its adventurers continuing the mission that Ralofir and Elkian began. Yet, as whispers of unrest and dark forces begin to rise once more, some have begun to question the official story of Ralofir’s death. Could there be more to his final battle than what history records?
