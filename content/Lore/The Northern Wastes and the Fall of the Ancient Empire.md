**Location**: North of Frostreach, beyond the Ironcrest Mountains  
**Current State**: Wasteland  

## History  
Before the rise of the three kingdoms, the **Ancient Empire** ruled the entire continent. Its heart lay in the northern regions, but after a mysterious event known as **The Winterfall**, the empire fell, and the land was cursed with unrelenting cold.  

Anyone who lingers too long in the Northern Wastes risks dangerous mutations. The undead and creatures warped by ancient magic roam the area.  

A few remnants of the empire remain, such as a system of stable yet mysterious **portals**, though their function is not fully understood.
