**Known History**:  
Ghonfuligar, a dragon of noble lineage, shared his early years with Sadrekkeor, another dragon who would become his closest companion. They grew up together, their friendship deeper than any bond between two beings. But a great tragedy befell Sadrekkeor's parents, leaving him consumed by a desire for power and vengeance. Over the next century, Sadrekkeor's might grew, fueled by this thirst for retribution.

When he was ready, Sadrekkeor and Ghonfuligar took on new identities—Elkian and Ralofir—to seek out the one responsible for the death of Sadrekkeor's family.

As they journeyed, they became legends in their own right, slaying countless villains and attracting new allies, eventually forming a party of four. Their quest led them to the necromancer Markul, who had desecrated Sadrekkeor’s mother, turning her into a zombie dragon. This heinous act pushed Sadrekkeor’s rage to new heights, distorting his desire for justice into a hunger for domination.

After they vanquished Markul, Sadrekkeor sought to convince Ralofir to join him in ruling over the mortal world, which he saw as irredeemably evil. But Ralofir, though also a powerful dragon, believed in the potential for good and sought to protect, not dominate. The two new members of their party sided with Sadrekkeor, seduced by his vision of power.

In a devastating act of betrayal, Sadrekkeor turned on Ralofir, driving a blade through his chest and casting him into a deep canyon, believing that he had eliminated the last obstacle in his path to total control. But Ralofir’s spirit, though wounded, remained unbroken, and his legacy as a hero and protector endured.
