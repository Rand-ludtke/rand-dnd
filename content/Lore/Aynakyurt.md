## History  
Aynakyurt is a kingdom known for its martial tradition, ruled by a noble monarchy tracing back several centuries. Initially, it was made up of many smaller duchies and city-states that united during the **First War of the Highlands**. This conflict began over control of the silver mines in the Grayspine Mountains. **Aynak I**, the first king, led these fractured states into unity, establishing a centralized monarchy.  

### Key Events:
- **The Silver Uprising**: A rebellion of common folk over poor mine conditions. It ended with reforms granting workers’ rights, strengthening the kingdom’s economy.
- **Markul’s March**: The necromancer Markul destroyed Aynakyurt’s ally Velastin, forcing Aynakyurt to call on neighboring kingdoms, leading to the formation of the **Three Kingdoms Pact**.  

Aynakyurt follows the teachings of **Torm**, with justice and valor at the core of its identity. Temples to Torm are prevalent throughout the kingdom, and the military views itself as protectors of both the kingdom and the world.
