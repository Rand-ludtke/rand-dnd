Eshlong is governed by an **Elective Monarchy**, meaning that the monarch is chosen by the nobility rather than inherited through bloodlines. This ensures that the monarch is elected based on merit, leadership qualities, and support from influential noble houses.

#### **Noble Families:**

- The kingdomâ€™s noble families control large swathes of land, primarily in the fertile **southern plains** and **forest territories**. Their wealth comes from the management of farms, magical resources, and trade routes.
- While the monarchy ensures a form of balance, these powerful families hold considerable sway in political matters, particularly when it comes to selecting the monarch.

#### **The Election Process:**

- Every **ten years**, noble families gather to vote for the next monarch. This is a highly competitive event where candidates are often the **head of noble houses** or **respected leaders** in the kingdom. The elected monarch must maintain **balance** between the competing interests of the noble houses.
