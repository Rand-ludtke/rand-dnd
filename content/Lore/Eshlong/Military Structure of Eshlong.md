Eshlong’s military is not as large or centralized as that of other kingdoms, but it is well-organized, particularly in defense of the kingdom’s borders, the forests, and the shores. **Magic** and **nature** play a key role in its structure, often seen in the form of **druidic warriors**, **mage-soldiers**, and **elven archers** who provide support to the regular troops.

#### **Key Components:**

- **Forest Rangers**: Skilled in both magic and combat, these soldiers patrol the forests and provide **early warning** for potential threats. They excel in **stealth**, **tracking**, and **guerrilla warfare**.
- **Magical Units**: Eshlong is home to numerous **mages** and **druids** who serve in the military. These spellcasters can call upon the elements, heal wounded soldiers, and create enchanted weapons and armor for battle.
- **Coastal Defense**: With its significant coastal territory, Eshlong maintains a fleet of **swift ships** for coastal defense, led by **water mages** who use their abilities to protect vital trade routes and defend against pirates or hostile invaders.
