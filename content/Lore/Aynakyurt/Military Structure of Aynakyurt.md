Aynakyurt’s military is divided into several branches:

1. **The Silver Blades**: The kingdom’s primary fighting force, led by high-ranking generals, this elite unit is renowned for its strength and discipline. They specialize in both swordsmanship and mounted combat. The Silver Blades also serve as royal bodyguards to the monarchy.
    
2. **The Templar Order**: These are the kingdom’s divine warriors, paladins of **Torm**, who serve both in battle and as enforcers of the kingdom’s laws. They are highly regarded, not only for their martial prowess but also for their deep connection to Torm’s teachings of courage and sacrifice.
    
3. **The Ashigaru**: The common foot soldiers of Aynakyurt, they are often recruited from the lower classes and serve in both defensive and offensive capacities. Though less prestigious than the Silver Blades, the Ashigaru form the backbone of Aynakyurt’s military might.
    
4. **The Onmyoji**: A special branch of spiritual warriors trained in magic, divination, and summoning. While not as numerous as the other branches, the Onmyoji play a critical role in both the military and the political landscape of Aynakyurt. They often serve as advisors and play key roles in understanding celestial omens and manipulating magical forces.
