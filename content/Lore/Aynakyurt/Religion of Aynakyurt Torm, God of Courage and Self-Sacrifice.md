The primary religion of Aynakyurt revolves around the worship of **Torm**, the **god of courage**, **self-sacrifice**, and **justice**. Torm is depicted as a noble figure clad in shining armor, symbolizing valor and duty. He is revered for his selfless acts and the sacrifices he made to protect the innocent, and his followers strive to emulate these ideals in their daily lives.

#### **Key Tenets of Torm’s Teachings:**

- **Self-Sacrifice:** The god’s teachings emphasize the importance of sacrifice for the greater good.
