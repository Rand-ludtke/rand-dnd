## History  
Aynakyurt is a kingdom known for its martial tradition, ruled by a noble monarchy tracing back several centuries. Initially, it was made up of many smaller duchies and city-states that united during the **First War of the Highlands**. This conflict began over control of the silver mines in the Grayspine Mountains. **Aynak I**, the first king, led these fractured states into unity, establishing a centralized monarchy.  

### Key Events:

#### **The Shogunate’s Reformation** (250 years ago, **13569**)

- **Overview:** Following the death of Aynak I, the kingdom descended into a period of political instability. During this time, the Shoguns of the Silver Blades held nearly total control, leading to widespread unrest. The turmoil ended when **Empress Keiko** ascended to the throne and implemented sweeping reforms. These reforms solidified the monarchy’s power, curtailed the military's influence, and established a more centralized governance structure, marking the beginning of the modern kingdom.

#### **Markul’s March** (150 years ago, **13719**)

- **Overview:** The necromancer **Markul** launched a devastating invasion that obliterated the kingdom of **Velastin**, which was an important ally to Aynakyurt. This catastrophic event led to the formation of the **Three Kingdoms Pact**, a defensive alliance between Aynakyurt, Whirong, and Eshlong, aimed at protecting the kingdom from further incursions. The pact strengthened Aynakyurt's alliances and set the stage for joint military efforts across the continent.

#### **The Iron Fist Accord** (200 years ago, **13669**)

- **Overview:** In an effort to secure Aynakyurt’s northern border and ensure stability, **King Raiden II** signed the **Iron Fist Accord** with the kingdom of **Varron**, a northern neighbor. This mutual defense pact bolstered Aynakyurt’s military strength and encouraged cross-border trade, significantly benefiting both kingdoms and fostering a long-lasting alliance.

#### **The Fall of the White Dragon Clan** (120 years ago, **13719**)

- **Overview:** The **White Dragon Clan**, a noble family with vast influence over Aynakyurt’s trade routes, was exposed for its involvement in corrupt dealings, including smuggling and slavery. The Shogunate swiftly executed the family’s members, marking the end of the traditional feudal system. The fall of the White Dragon Clan helped pave the way for more centralized control under the monarchy, diminishing the power of noble families.

#### **The Silver Uprising** (100 years ago, **13739**)

- **Overview:** The **Silver Uprising** was sparked by widespread discontent among the common folk, particularly miners who faced grueling conditions in the kingdom's silver mines. The rebellion was quelled, but it led to significant reforms, including the establishment of workers' rights and labor protections. These changes strengthened the kingdom’s economy by improving worker conditions, leading to increased productivity and stability.

#### **The Battle of Grayspine** (50 years ago, **13769**)

- **Overview:** Tensions erupted over control of the valuable silver veins in the **Grayspine Mountains**, leading to a civil conflict between the monarchy and rebellious noble families. The **Battle of Grayspine** was a decisive victory for **General Hiroshi Takeda**, whose forces crushed the rebellion and reaffirmed the monarchy’s authority. This victory solidified the Shogunate's dominance over the silver-producing regions and ensured the continued prosperity of the kingdom.

#### **The Great Earthquake of Silverkeep** (50 years ago, **13769**)

- **Overview:** A devastating earthquake struck the capital city of **Silverkeep**, causing widespread destruction and loss of life. The national response to the disaster was swift, with a massive reconstruction effort underway. During this period, architects and engineers developed new earthquake-resistant techniques for rebuilding the city, which helped to reduce the risk of future devastation and reinforced the kingdom’s resilience in the face of natural disasters.

#### **The Expansion of the Silverkeep Academy** (25 years ago, **13794**)

- **Overview:** Once a modest military training ground, **Silverkeep Academy** expanded dramatically, transforming into a prestigious center for both martial and academic study. It began accepting students beyond the military, including those interested in diplomacy, strategy, and divine magic. This expansion elevated the Academy's reputation, making it one of the most respected institutions in the kingdom and a major influence on the nation’s military, political, and academic future.

Aynakyurt follows the teachings of **Torm**, with justice and valor at the core of its identity. Temples to Torm are prevalent throughout the kingdom, and the military views itself as protectors of both the kingdom and the world.
