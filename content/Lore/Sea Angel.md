**Overview**  
The Sea Angel is a rarely manifested deity that appears as an enormous, spectral sea angel when it does show itself. Known for its silence, it nonetheless grants blessings of power to those dedicated to its cause. Followers, primarily vengeance paladins, believe the Sea Angel "consumes" the souls of sacred quarries that are delivered to the ocean.

**Symbol**  
A glass or metal sea angel, often simplistic in design, serves as the Sea Angel's symbol and is used in rituals and shrines.

**Worship and Vengeance**  
The Sea Angel does not provide explicit guidance but gives its followers strength to seek justice. The sacred custom requires presenting the bodies, or symbolic pieces, of defeated targets at the water.
