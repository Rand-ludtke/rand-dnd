**Event**: Markul's Destruction of Velastin  
**Time**: 175-150 years ago

## **The Fall of Velastin**

Markul, a once-promising necromancer from the Republic of Whirong, was known for his intellectual brilliance and thirst for knowledge. Initially, his studies in necromancy were seen as a noble pursuit in the name of scientific advancement. However, Markul’s ambitions grew darker as he began to dabble with forbidden magics—magic that sought to raise the dead, manipulate souls, and bend the very essence of life and death to his will.

Over time, Markul became obsessed with power. He sought the knowledge of ancient, lost rituals, often at great cost to both his sanity and his morality. He turned his back on his fellow scholars in Whirong and ventured into the darkest corners of the world to unearth forbidden tomes and artifacts. One such artifact, an ancient relic said to be infused with the essence of death itself, granted him immense power, but it came with a terrible price: it bound Markul’s soul to the realm of the dead, transforming him into something beyond mortal comprehension.

With his newfound powers, Markul raised an army of undead legions. The kingdom of **Velastin**, a peaceful and prosperous land nestled between the mountains and coasts, became his first target. Velastin was known for its vibrant culture, rich trade routes, and commitment to diplomacy, but it had no defense against the sheer overwhelming power of Markul's necromantic forces.

The undead swept through Velastin with horrifying speed, overwhelming the kingdom’s forces and civilians alike. Markul’s army of mindless soldiers tore through towns and villages, leaving nothing but death and decay in their wake. The once-thriving kingdom fell in a matter of weeks. The devastation was unimaginable. The heart of the kingdom, its capital, was obliterated, and its citizens either slaughtered or turned into mindless undead.

The fall of Velastin sent shockwaves through the continent. No one had believed that such an evil force could exist—let alone bring down a kingdom as prosperous and powerful as Velastin. Markul’s rise signaled a terrifying shift in the balance of power, and his unrelenting march toward conquest showed no signs of stopping. His army was vast, and his mastery over death seemed unstoppable. Nations across the continent feared for their survival, as Markul’s influence began to spread.

## **Formation of the Three Kingdoms Pact**

In response to Markul’s terrifying power, the neighboring kingdoms of **Aynakyurt**, **Whirong**, and **Eshlong** realized they could not stand alone against such a threat. After much deliberation, they forged an alliance—the **Three Kingdoms Pact**—a coalition built to defend against Markul’s undead legions and prevent further destruction.

- **Aynakyurt**, with its rich military history and powerful forces, took on the responsibility of providing the bulk of the Pact's military strength. Its disciplined armies, seasoned generals, and vast knowledge of warfare were critical in organizing an effective defense and staging counterattacks. The kingdom also supplied vital strategic leadership in the planning of battles.
    
- **Whirong**, known for its technological advancements, contributed its formidable expertise in weaponry and military strategy. The Republic’s Artificers Association crafted powerful weapons and war machines to aid the alliance, many of which were infused with magical enhancements to counteract the necromantic forces. Whirong's leaders also devised innovative battle strategies, helping to turn the tide in key conflicts.
    
- **Eshlong**, with its deep connection to nature and powerful magical traditions, provided the essential magical and natural aid needed to combat Markul’s necromantic forces. Eshlong’s most powerful mages, druids, and rangers lent their magic to the cause, using their power to cleanse the land of Markul’s corruption and bolster the morale of the allied armies. The kingdom also provided vital knowledge of ancient rituals that helped bind Markul’s magic.
    

The alliance was led by two of the most renowned figures of the time: **Elkian Sageheart** and **Ralofir Fallbreeze**. Together, they orchestrated the defense of the continent, rallying armies, uniting various factions, and devising a plan to confront Markul directly.

After years of battles, skirmishes, and losses, the allied forces finally faced Markul’s army in a decisive confrontation. The **Battle of the Frozen Tide** was fought at the edges of the southern coast, where Markul’s undead forces clashed with the combined might of the Three Kingdoms Pact. The battle was brutal, and the cost was high, but after a harrowing struggle, the forces of the alliance emerged victorious. However, the victory came at a devastating price: **Ralofir Fallbreeze**, was mortally wounded in the final clash with, Ralofir’s body was never recovered.

With Markul’s death at the hands of the alliance forces, his undead army crumbled, and the immediate threat to the continent was vanquished. However, his legacy of fear and destruction would linger for generations.

In the aftermath of the battle, **Elkian Sageheart** vowed to ensure that the world would never again be unprepared for such a threat. To this end, he established the **Adventurers’ Guild**, an organization that would serve as both a network for exploring the unknown and a force to combat emerging dangers. The guild’s mission was to uncover the forgotten corners of the world, study the dark magics of the past, and ensure that the forces of evil could never again rise unchecked.

The **Three Kingdoms Pact** remains strong to this day, though it has evolved over the centuries. The alliance’s core ideals of unity, protection, and vigilance continue to shape the politics and military strategies of Aynakyurt, Whirong, and Eshlong, even as the threat of Markul’s return lingers in the minds of many.
