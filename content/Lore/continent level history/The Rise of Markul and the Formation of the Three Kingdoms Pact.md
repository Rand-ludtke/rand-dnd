**Event**: Markul's Destruction of Velastin  
**Time**: 175-150 years ago  

## The Fall of Velastin  
Markul, a necromancer who once studied in the Republic of Whirong, turned his knowledge toward dark magic. His undead legions quickly overran the peaceful kingdom of **Velastin**, shocking the neighboring nations.  

## Formation of the Three Kingdoms Pact  
The devastation led **Aynakyurt**, **Whirong**, and **Eshlong** to form an alliance—the **Three Kingdoms Pact**—to stop Markul’s spread.  

- **Aynakyurt**: Provided military strength.  
- **Whirong**: Contributed advanced weaponry and strategy.  
- **Eshlong**: Offered magical and natural aid.  

Led by **Elkian Sageheart** and **Ralofir Fallbreeze**, the allied forces eventually confronted Markul. Though victorious, the heroes suffered the tragic loss of **Ralofir** in the final battle. Elkian vowed to protect the world from future threats, establishing the **Adventurers' Guild** shortly after.
