**Location**: South of the Three Kingdoms, beyond the borders of Eshlong, Whirong, and Aynakyurt
**Current State**: Untamed, dangerous, and largely unexplored

### **Overview**

The **Southern Wildlands** stretch across a vast, uncharted region south of the **Three Kingdoms**, encompassing dense jungles, swamps, and towering mountain ranges. It is a land steeped in mystery, where the natural world thrives untamed, and the forces of magic and nature seem to bend in ways that defy the laws of the known world. Despite the many attempts to explore and colonize the region, it remains a wild and unpredictable frontier. Few people have ventured into its heart and returned, and even fewer have ventured deep enough to uncover its secrets.

The Wildlands are home to numerous powerful creatures, some of which are thought to be lost or forgotten species, while others are magical aberrations born from the land’s strange, volatile energy. The jungles are teeming with dangerous predators, and ancient ruins dot the landscape—evidence of a civilization long lost to time.

### **Geography**

The Southern Wildlands are known for their **vast jungles**, **swamps**, and **craggy mountains**, each terrain more dangerous than the last. A treacherous jungle canopy blankets much of the land, where towering trees and thick foliage obscure the sky and shelter dangerous beasts, magical creatures, and even ancient traps. Hidden within this labyrinth of green are ruined temples, cities, and monuments, but they are often buried beneath centuries of growth or swallowed by thick, choking vines.

To the south, the terrain gradually gives way to **swamps** and **marshes**, where the land becomes unstable and treacherous. The ground here is soft, boggy, and difficult to traverse, with quicksand pits and poisonous plants lurking beneath the surface. It is said that strange creatures—some humanoid, others monstrous—dwell in these swamps, keeping watch over the ancient relics hidden beneath the waters.

Beyond the marshes, the land rises into jagged, uncharted **mountains**, where storms are frequent and mysterious. These peaks are rumored to harbor ancient secrets, but no one has successfully mapped the region due to constant magical disturbances and violent weather patterns.

### **History**

The Southern Wildlands are believed to have once been the southern edge of an ancient and powerful civilization, known for its mastery of magic and vast knowledge. This kingdom, whose name has been lost to time, is thought to have ruled over much of the continent at its height, but the Wildlands themselves were not fully conquered or colonized.

It is speculated that the Wildlands were considered **too dangerous** even for this ancient kingdom. Although they controlled much of the surrounding lands, the Wildlands were seen as a place where the forces of nature were too chaotic, where magic ran wild, and where monstrous creatures roamed without fear. The kingdom is believed to have erected some of the **old ruins** scattered across the Wildlands, but these were likely outposts or temples rather than settlements, and their purpose remains shrouded in mystery.

The idea that the Wildlands were part of the ancient kingdom has long been debated by scholars and adventurers. While some artifacts have been uncovered that appear to link the region to the lost civilization, the sheer danger of the land has led many to believe the kingdom deliberately avoided the region. Some even speculate that the kingdom’s downfall may have been hastened by a failed attempt to tame the Wildlands, as ancient magical disasters and strange phenomena are said to have caused the collapse of many settlements on its borders.

After the fall of this ancient kingdom, the Wildlands were left untouched for centuries, and its mysteries became wrapped in myth. The land was said to be cursed, with strange creatures, magical storms, and illogical disturbances that made it impossible for any civilization to take hold. Even today, the Wildlands remain a place of **danger and uncertainty**, a stark contrast to the once great empire that lay just beyond its borders.

### **Legends and Mysticism**

The Southern Wildlands are not just a geographic location—they are an integral part of **local mythologies** and **legends** across the continent. Various cultures speak of **ancient beings**, **forgotten gods**, and powerful spirits that guard the land, preventing anyone from establishing lasting control.

#### **The Forgotten Gods**

According to some legends, the ruins scattered throughout the Wildlands are not just remnants of a lost civilization, but temples and altars dedicated to **forgotten gods** or **old ones**—beings of immense power who once walked the earth and wielded influence over nature and magic. These deities are said to still haunt the Wildlands, their power lingering in the land and affecting the world around them. Some stories suggest that the magic of the Wildlands is the residue of their ancient pacts, and that any who enter are subject to their will.

#### **The Guardians**

The Wildlands are also said to be home to **powerful, ancient creatures** that serve as guardians to the land and its secrets. These creatures are sometimes described as beasts of unimaginable size and strength, others as magical entities or spirits that exist to protect the land from outsiders. Some of the most famous guardians include:

- **The Jade Serpent**: A colossal, mystical serpent said to slither through the jungle, protecting sacred sites and temples. Its gaze is said to turn intruders into stone, and only those deemed worthy by the serpent are allowed to pass unharmed.
- **The Silent Ones**: Mysterious beings that are said to lurk within the mist-covered swamps, watching over hidden treasures. No one knows what they truly are, but their presence is often felt by those who venture too far into the swamps.

### **Current State**

Today, the **Southern Wildlands** remain largely unexplored and uncolonized. Expeditions continue to be launched, but the dangers are immense. **Magical storms**, **dangerous wildlife**, **ancient traps**, and the eerie presence of powerful guardians ensure that few can endure the Wildlands for long.

The Wildlands are often viewed as a forbidden realm, a place where even the most powerful kingdoms hesitate to trespass. The region is often associated with mystery, ancient knowledge, and forgotten magic. Only the most daring adventurers, scholars, and treasure hunters venture into its depths, hoping to uncover the lost secrets of the Wildlands, but their efforts are often thwarted by the very land they seek to conquer.

In the **Three Kingdoms**, whispers of the Wildlands' secrets persist. **Whirong**, with its focus on discovery and innovation, occasionally sends teams of artificers and mages to study the magical storms and ancient ruins, hoping to harness the powerful energy that pervades the land. **Eshlong** and **Aynakyurt** also maintain a cautious interest, with **Aynakyurt** sending military expeditions to protect trade routes from any threats emanating from the southern jungles.
