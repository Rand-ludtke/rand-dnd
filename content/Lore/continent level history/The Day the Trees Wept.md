### **Description**

On a fateful day two decades ago, an eerie and unexplainable phenomenon swept across the continent. Across every forest, grove, and lone tree, the branches sagged as if weighed down by an unseen sorrow. Leaves drooped, some turning brittle and brown despite the season. Sap seeped slowly down their trunks, resembling tears—giving rise to the event’s name: _The Day the Trees Wept._

In tandem with the trees’ strange behavior, birds across the land fell silent. They took to the skies only to circle aimlessly, never venturing far from their nests. As twilight descended, the air filled with an unsettling harmony—the songs of birds, but unlike any heard before or since. Their voices carried haunting, sorrowful melodies, as if mourning the loss of something ancient and irreplaceable. Even crows, owls, and other creatures known for their harsh cries added to this strange chorus of lament.

The event lasted for a full day, from dawn to dusk. When night finally arrived, the birds ceased their song, and the trees seemed to regain some strength, though many still swayed, as if burdened by an unshakeable grief. The morning after, life slowly returned to normal, but those who had witnessed the event never forgot the strange stillness and sadness that had blanketed the land.

### **Theories and Speculation**

Despite decades of research by scholars, druids, and sages, no explanation has been found for the event. Some say it was an omen—a warning of a coming calamity. Others believe the world itself mourned the loss of a powerful force, though no one knows what was lost. The connection between the weeping trees and the birds' sorrowful songs remains a mystery, though many suggest that nature, in some deep way, felt a terrible absence.

A few rumors have emerged, whispered in hushed tones by those who still claim to have felt a presence on that day—a vast, benevolent spirit leaving the world, or the shattering of an ancient pact between beings long forgotten. In remote villages, some believe it marked the death of a god or guardian spirit, while others blame the actions of mortals meddling with magic beyond their understanding.

### **Impact on the Present**

Even after twenty years, the event lingers in the minds of many. Some trees affected that day still seem wilted, their trunks scarred with odd patterns resembling tears, no matter how healthy the forests around them. Birds, especially certain songbirds, occasionally revert to the strange, mournful melodies they sang during the event, unsettling travelers and reminding locals of that strange day.

Adventurers and scholars have begun to notice patterns—places where the trees’ weeping seemed more intense or where birds refused to sing for weeks after. Though these regions appear normal on the surface, something feels off beneath the soil, as if the earth itself remembers a sorrow it cannot explain.

The Day the Trees Wept remains a haunting enigma, a reminder that even in a world of heroes and gods, there are forces beyond understanding—forces that, for reasons unknown, felt the need to mourn.
