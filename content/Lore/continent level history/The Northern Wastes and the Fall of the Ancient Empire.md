**Location**: North of Frostreach, beyond the Ironcrest Mountains  
**Current State**: Wasteland  

## **History**

The Northern Wastes were once the heartland of the **Ancient Empire**, a vast and powerful civilization that spanned much of the continent before the rise of the Three Kingdoms. The empire was known for its unmatched technological, magical, and military prowess. Its capital, now lost to time, was located deep in the northern reaches, where the **Ironcrest Mountains** meet the icy tundras of the north.

However, the empire's golden age came to a catastrophic end in an event known as **The Winterfall**. The exact cause of the Winterfall remains a matter of speculation, but it is believed that the empire’s hubris in wielding powerful ancient magics, possibly even attempting to harness the forces of nature itself, triggered a catastrophic backlash. The skies darkened, snow began to fall year-round, and an unnatural chill gripped the land. The once-thriving empire was quickly consumed by an endless winter, and its people were either frozen or transformed by the dark magic that swept across the land.

Some say that the empire attempted to breach the **Veil of the Gods**—a forbidden boundary that separates the mortal realm from the divine. Others whisper that an ancient being, an elemental force or forgotten god, awoke in response to the empire's ambitions, unleashing the devastating Winterfall to punish their arrogance. Regardless of the true cause, the result was the same: an entire civilization was destroyed, and the land was forever cursed.

Now, the Northern Wastes are a desolate, frozen wasteland. The once-vibrant cities of the empire lie buried under layers of ice and snow, their ruins only partially visible through the howling blizzards. The ancient forests that once stretched across the land have been replaced by nothing but barren, frost-covered landscapes. The magic that once flourished in the empire has twisted and warped the land, creating dangerous anomalies and rifts in reality.

Mutations and twisted creatures roam the Wastes—undead warriors, once-loyal soldiers of the empire, rise from the snow as revenants cursed to walk the earth for eternity. Other creatures, warped by the ancient magics, have evolved into horrific and grotesque forms, making the Wastes even more dangerous to those foolish enough to venture too far. The effects of the Winterfall also manifest in the form of **corrupted zones**, where the land itself seems to twist and distort, and reality bends in unnatural ways. Anyone who stays in the Wastes too long risks being changed—body, mind, and soul—by the lingering magic.

Despite the dangers, there are still a few remnants of the Ancient Empire scattered throughout the Wastes. **Ancient portals**, strange and stable rifts in space and time, have been discovered in some of the ruins. These portals seem to be remnants of the empire's attempts to tap into planar magic or perhaps a means of interdimensional travel. Their true function is not fully understood, but many scholars believe they were part of the empire’s ambition to access other realms or even manipulate time itself. Some of these portals are still functional, though the destinations remain a mystery. Adventurers, treasure hunters, and mages seeking to unlock the secrets of the empire often risk entering these portals, but few ever return.

The Winterfall has left its scars on the land and the people who live near it. Frostreach, the closest city to the Northern Wastes, stands as the last bastion of civilization in the region. Its residents are hardy and resilient, but even they are wary of the creeping influence of the Wastes. There are tales of settlements further north, now long forgotten, whose inhabitants were lost to the madness and mutations caused by the dark forces that still linger in the region.

The Northern Wastes, once a center of unimaginable power and prosperity, now stand as a frozen reminder of the empire's fall and the price of unchecked ambition. Though many have tried to uncover its secrets, the Wastes remain an inhospitable, cursed land, and its true story is buried beneath the endless snow
