Lyra stands in a vast, white void, its emptiness stretching endlessly in all directions. The silence is thick, broken only by the soft rustle of feathers as skeletal birds—countless in number—begin to appear around her. Some perch, others hover, their hollow eye sockets fixed on her.

Their collective gaze feels almost expectant. Lyra fluffs her cloak instinctively, perhaps striking a small pose for the attention, but the birds’ expressions don’t change. In unison, they speak, their voices soft and hollow:  
**"We are one."**

The phrase repeats, a haunting chorus growing louder and then fading abruptly. The silence returns, heavy and strange. The skeletal birds remain, watching her with unwavering intensity.

After what feels like an eternity, two larger skeletons appear. Humanoid, shimmering faintly with a strange light, they stand motionless, their hollow gazes locked onto Lyra. She tilts her head, perhaps mimicking their stillness, then tries to speak. Her usual cheerful chatter seems to bounce off them, met only by silence. They do not move, do not react—just stare blankly, like all the others.

After a while, with no response from the figures or the birds, Lyra begins to move. She strides through the field of skeletal birds, her steps purposeful as their heads turn to follow her. The weight of their stares is strange, but she brushes it off, perhaps offering a little wave here and there, as if hoping for applause or acknowledgement.

Without warning, the white void shifts into a dense forest, alive with towering trees and intricate treehouses connected by woven rope bridges. The scene should be lively, but instead, it is frozen in chaos.

The forest is ablaze, fire consuming the treehouses and scorching the jungle below. But the flames are frozen in place, unmoving. Smoke hangs suspended in the air, and falling embers glint like captured stars, unmoving in the timeless inferno.

Among the destruction are thousands of skeletons—avian and humanoid—standing motionless, their empty sockets trained on Lyra. Their silence presses against her, a wordless question or demand she can’t quite place.

Ahead, atop a grand staircase woven from the roots of a massive tree, lies a throne carved from wood and vines. On the throne sit two larger skeletons, their stillness even more imposing here. Behind them, carved into the bark of the tree itself, looms a massive symbol: a billowing cloak etched in fine detail, holding the delicate shape of a single dogwood flower.

Lyra stops for a moment, perhaps tilting her head in thought or confusion, before deciding to climb the staircase. Her steps echo faintly, though the scene around her remains frozen and silent. At the top, the skeletons on the throne watch her without reaction, their hollow stares filled with something she can’t quite name.

She stays for a moment, then descends, talking lightly as she goes. Her words hang in the air, unanswered. The skeletal figures lining her path watch silently, unmoving, as she continues to wander through the frozen chaos of the burning forest.

After what feels like hours—or perhaps days—the scene shifts again. Lyra finds herself at the base of a colossal dogwood tree, its trunk ancient and gnarled. The tree, too, is aflame, its white blossoms and pink leaves consumed by fire. Yet, as before, the flames are still, and burning petals hang suspended midair like a surreal rain.

Lyra pauses, her gaze drawn upward to the burning canopy. She sits down at the base of the tree, idly tracing patterns in the dirt or humming to herself. The silence is overwhelming, but she seems unbothered by it, occasionally looking around as if expecting someone to break the stillness.

Years seem to pass. The weight of time presses on the scene, but Lyra remains unchanged, her birdlike attention flickering from one detail to the next.

Finally, she begins to sing. Her voice is light and lilting, the melody an instinctive tune that fills the timeless void. As the last note fades, the dream fractures, and Lyra wakes.
