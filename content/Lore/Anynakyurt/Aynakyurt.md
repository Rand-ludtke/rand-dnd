## History  
Aynakyurt is a kingdom known for its martial tradition, ruled by a noble monarchy tracing back several centuries. Initially, it was made up of many smaller duchies and city-states that united during the **First War of the Highlands**. This conflict began over control of the silver mines in the Grayspine Mountains. **Aynak I**, the first king, led these fractured states into unity, establishing a centralized monarchy.  

### Key Events:
- **The Silver Uprising**(100 years ago): A rebellion of common folk over poor mine conditions. It ended with reforms granting workers’ rights, strengthening the kingdom’s economy.
	
- **Markul’s March**(150ish years ago): The necromancer Markul destroyed Aynakyurt’s ally Velastin, forcing Aynakyurt to call on neighboring kingdoms, leading to the formation of the **Three Kingdoms Pact**.  
	
- - **The Shogunate’s Reformation** (250 years ago): Following a period of political instability after Aynak I’s death, the kingdom was governed by a powerful military class, the **Shoguns of the Silver Blades**, who ruled in the name of the king but exercised nearly total control over the nation. This era was marked by constant internal strife and skirmishes between rival military clans. The conflict ended when **Empress Keiko**, a distant descendant of Aynak I, ascended to the throne and initiated sweeping reforms that solidified the monarchy’s power while curtailing the military’s influence. Under Keiko’s rule, Aynakyurt saw the rise of a more centralized bureaucracy, greater infrastructure development, and a codification of laws that integrated the principles of Torm into the legal system.
    
- **The Battle of Grayspine** (50 years ago): The Grayspine Mountains, still the kingdom’s most important resource, became the focal point of a brutal civil conflict when the noble houses of Aynakyurt feuded over control of the silver veins. The conflict came to a head at the **Battle of Grayspine**, where the kingdom’s military, led by General **Hiroshi Takeda**, decisively defeated a coalition of rebellious noble families who had hoped to secede from the kingdom. This battle reaffirmed the monarchy’s central authority, though it left the kingdom with deep scars and a lingering distrust of the noble houses, many of whom had taken part in the rebellion. General Takeda, a celebrated war hero, is now one of the kingdom’s most honored historical figures.
    
- **The Expansion of the Silverkeep Academy** (25 years ago): Silverkeep, the capital, is home to one of the most prestigious military academies in Rozia. Originally a small training ground for soldiers, the **Silverkeep Academy** has expanded its influence over the years, eventually becoming a center of both martial and academic study. In recent years, the academy has started to accept non-military students, particularly those interested in fields related to strategy, diplomacy, and divine magic. This shift has helped foster a more enlightened approach to governance and has contributed to the strengthening of Aynakyurt’s standing as a cultural and military powerhouse.
	
- **The Iron Fist Accord** (200 years ago): In a bid to strengthen the kingdom’s defense against outside threats, King **Raiden II** signed the **Iron Fist Accord** with the neighboring kingdom of **Varron**, a harsh northern land known for its warriors. The agreement established a mutual defense pact and encouraged trade between the two kingdoms, with the understanding that any threat to one kingdom would be a threat to both. The accord has since been credited with maintaining the peace in the region for nearly two centuries, though there have been periodic tensions due to Varron’s more militaristic approach to diplomacy.
    
- **The Fall of the White Dragon Clan** (120 years ago): Once a powerful noble family, the White Dragon Clan was infamous for its vast influence over the kingdom's economy, particularly the lucrative trade routes through the coastal provinces. Their downfall came when they were implicated in a series of corrupt dealings involving smuggling and illegal slave trades. The **Shogunate**, still in power at the time, swiftly executed the family’s leaders and confiscated their wealth. This event marked the end of the traditional feudal system, signaling the start of the more centralized monarchy under Empress Keiko.
    
- **The Great Earthquake of Silverkeep** (50 years ago): A massive earthquake struck Silverkeep, causing widespread destruction. Many of the city’s older buildings, including parts of the Silverkeep Palace, were damaged or collapsed. The disaster prompted a nationwide reconstruction effort that led to the development of earthquake-resistant architectural techniques. It also sparked a wave of national solidarity, as people from all regions of the kingdom came to the aid of Silverkeep's citizens, strengthening the bond between the royal family and the common folk.

Aynakyurt follows the teachings of **Torm**, with justice and valor at the core of its identity. Temples to Torm are prevalent throughout the kingdom, and the military views itself as protectors of both the kingdom and the world.
