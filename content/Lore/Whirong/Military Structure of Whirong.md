Whirong’s military is a complex and highly organized force that reflects the nation’s diverse society and its emphasis on technological innovation. The Republic’s military is divided into specialized branches that include not only traditional forces but also magical and technological units. With the influence of the **Artificers Association**, Whirong’s military is known for its cutting-edge technology and **golem** forces, making it a formidable power in the region.

#### **Key Military Branches:**

1. **The Ironstone Army**
    
    - The main land-based military force of Whirong, stationed primarily in **Ironstone** and the surrounding iron-rich mountain regions. The Ironstone Army is known for its **heavily armored soldiers** and **war machines**, including **ballistae**, **siege engines**, and **mechanized golems**. Most soldiers in this division are trained in standard combat, but there is a heavy emphasis on using **advanced technology** to maintain a tactical advantage.
    - **Golem Corps**: A specialized unit of war golems, created by the **Artificers Association**, that are used for large-scale battles and defense of key locations. These golems are often equipped with elemental enchantments, making them powerful against both magical and physical threats.
2. **The Silver Hand Cavalry**
    
    - A highly mobile and versatile cavalry force, based in **Craglen**, known for swift raids, border defense, and rapid responses to skirmishes. The Silver Hand Cavalry is trained in traditional warfare but is also adept at **hit-and-run tactics**, using light **mechanized carts** and **magical steeds** to carry out lightning-fast strikes.
    - **Arcane Riders**: A subset of the cavalry, these soldiers are mages who ride **arcane beasts** or **elemental mounts** and wield both magic and weapons. Their job is to provide magical support on the battlefield and bolster the offensive capabilities of Whirong’s cavalry.
3. **The Goldfall Navy**
    
    - Goldfall's **navy** is primarily responsible for protecting the Republic’s coastlines, especially in the **trade-heavy ports** of Goldfall and Curguard. The fleet includes traditional warships, as well as **arcane-powered vessels** designed by the Artificers Association. These ships are capable of long-distance travel and provide crucial security for Whirong’s maritime trade routes.
    - **Magical Naval Units**: A new branch formed after the **Markul's March**, these naval units consist of mages and artificers who create **defensive wards** for ships and develop **magical weapons** for sea combat, including **ballistae** that fire **arcane projectiles**.
4. **The Steel Guards**
    
    - An elite unit of **special forces**, the Steel Guards are tasked with **covert operations**, including **espionage**, **assassination**, and **sabotage**. They are highly skilled in both magic and traditional combat and are often sent on dangerous missions to infiltrate enemy lines or gather crucial intelligence. The Steel Guards are highly respected and feared, with some members even rumored to be **enchanted mercenaries** or **magical constructs**.
5. **Mercenary Bands and Militia**
    
    - As Whirong is a republic built on trade and diversity, many cities also maintain **local militias** and employ **mercenary groups** for defense. These groups are often used for internal security or when defending borders against potential secessionist forces. The **Mercenary Wars** proved the value of these informal forces in holding the nation together during times of unrest.

#### **Military Strategy**:

Whirong’s military strategy focuses on **technological superiority**, **versatility**, and **fast, coordinated strikes**. The country’s reliance on **magical and technological advancements** ensures that the Republic has a formidable defense, but Whirong also values **diplomacy** and **alliances**. During **Markul’s March**, Whirong used its strategic positioning to offer military aid to neighboring countries, showing its value as a key player in the continent’s balance of power.
