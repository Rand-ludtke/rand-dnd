#### **History of Whirong**

Whirong began as a loose confederation of trade cities, with **Ironstone** at its heart. The region prospered from its central location on the continent, serving as a crossroads for commerce, culture, and knowledge. The foundation of Whirong as a republic was laid after the **Great Inventors' Rebellion**, in which the guilds of merchants, artificers, and scholars overthrew the old nobility, seizing control of the region. This led to the establishment of a council-based government, which, over time, evolved into the modern **Republic of Whirong**.

The rise of Whirong was aided by its diverse culture and open embrace of new ideas. As the republic grew, it became a beacon for **scholars**, **inventors**, and **artificers**, all of whom sought to expand the boundaries of knowledge. Over the centuries, Whirong has faced external threats and internal struggles, but it has remained a hub of progress and innovation.
