**Wondrous Item, very rare**
This amulet appears as a simple, obsidian-black pendant, devoid of any reflection. To **Detect Magic**, it appears to be a void not like ambient mana but a void.

- **Feature: Spell Scribe**  
    While wearing this amulet, it silently records every spell you cast. If the amulet is removed, it immediately casts **all recorded spells** in random order, centered on the wearer or their previous location as appropriate for the spell's targeting. Any spells without viable targets backfire.
    
- **Drawback: Erratic Release**  
    When the stored spells are released, they **ignore any conditions or restrictions** (e.g., casting components, concentration, etc.). This often creates chaotic results.
    
- **Reset**  
    The amulet reverts to a dull black after releasing its stored magic and requires a **long rest** before it can begin recording again.
