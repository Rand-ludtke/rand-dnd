### **Background:**

The _Revolver of the Damned_ was rumored to be forged by an undead gunslinger who sought eternal vengeance on those who wronged him. Each bullet fired carries a fragment of his soul, striking true against the living and dragging the unworthy closer to the grave.

This weapon glows faintly under the light of the full moon, its grip cold to the touch as if haunted by lingering shadows. A faint whisper accompanies its firing, sending shivers down the spine of its wielder.

#### **Flavor Text:**

Legends claim that every soul struck by the revolver becomes part of its essence, feeding its insatiable hunger for despair. Those who wield the weapon too long find their own shadows growing darker, and their dreams haunted by the cries of the damned.

 **The Curse of the Damned**

The _Revolver of the Damned_ corrupts its wielder with every use, binding their soul closer to its malevolent power. Each time the wielder fires the revolver, they gain **1 point of Corruption**.

As Corruption accumulates, the revolver’s influence manifests in increasingly severe ways.

---

 **Corruption Thresholds**

 **0–50 Corruption Points: Awakening the Whisper**

- **Effect:** None. The wielder may notice faint whispers or shadows at the edge of their vision, but these are harmless and ignorable.

---

 **50–75 Corruption Points: Shadow-Touched**

- The wielder's presence feels slightly off to others, as shadows linger unnaturally. Animals shy away, and faint whispering grows louder.
- **Effect:** The wielder gains darkvision out to 60 ft. (or increases their existing darkvision by 30 ft.).
- **Flavor:** Shadows seem drawn to the wielder, giving their silhouette a faintly menacing aura.

---

 **75–100 Corruption Points: Warden of Shadows**

- The revolver begins to feed off the wielder’s emotions, amplifying anger and despair. The whispers are now impossible to ignore, urging acts of wrath and destruction.
- **Effect:** The revolver's necrotic damage on critical hits increases to **4d6**, and its piercing damage increases to **1d12**.
- **Drawback:** The wielder suffers disadvantage on Wisdom (Insight) and Charisma (Persuasion) checks.

---

 **100–150 Corruption Points: Marked by the Damned**

- The wielder’s physical appearance begins to change subtly. Their eyes darken, veins near the hands blacken, and their voice takes on an echoing, hollow quality.
- **Effect:** The wielder gains resistance to necrotic damage.
- **Drawback:** The wielder has disadvantage on saving throws against being charmed or frightened.

---

 **150–300 Corruption Points: Soul-Bound Avatar**

- The revolver fully binds to the wielder's soul, granting immense power at a terrible cost. They now act as an extension of the weapon's will.
- **Effect:**
    - The revolver’s necrotic damage on critical hits increases to **6d6**.
    - The wielder's melee and ranged attacks count as magical for overcoming resistances.
    - The wielder has advantage on attack rolls made with the revolver.
- **Drawback:**
    - The wielder cannot willingly part with the revolver.
    - At the start of the turn, the wielder must attack the nearest enemy immediately as an action. If no enemies are in sight, the wielder targets the nearest living creature.

---

 **300+ Corruption Points: The Damned One**

- The wielder is consumed entirely by the revolver’s dark essence, becoming a mindless avatar of vengeance and death. Their soul is irrevocably lost.
- **Effect:** The wielder is no longer under their own control, becoming an NPC antagonist controlled by the DM.
- **Final Transformation:** The wielder’s physical form becomes withered and deathly, their eyes glowing with a faint green light.

---

**Removing the Curse**

The curse cannot be removed through ordinary magical means, such as _Remove Curse_. To break the bond, the revolver must be destroyed at a place of consecrated vengeance or redemption (e.g., a shrine of justice or a god of retribution).

If the wielder dies while holding the revolver, their soul is trapped within it, unable to be resurrected unless the revolver is destroyed.
