**Wondrous Item, rare**
This small, brightly colored card bears the symbol of a reverse arrow and hums faintly with arcane energy.

- **Reaction: Uno Reverse**  
    As a reaction when a creature you can see within 60 feet casts a spell, you can present the Uno Reverse Card to cast **Counterspell** at 4th level without expending a spell slot. This feature can be used **once per day** and resets at dawn.  
    The card can only be used if you "flip it" theatrically while shouting "UNO REVERSE!" (or a phrase of similar energy).

**Curse of Reversal**  
    At the DM's discretion, if the card is misused for mundane tasks, like reversing simple arguments or jokes, it might backfire by inverting the intended effect of the next Counterspell.
