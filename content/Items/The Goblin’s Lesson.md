**Wondrous Item, uncommon (no attunement required)**  
This object is disguised as a valuable piece of loot, such as a gemstone, coin pouch, or ornate trinket. It radiates **evocation magic** under Detect Magic.

- **Feature: Delayed Explosion**  
    The item is cursed with a **delayed evocation charge**. Once picked up, it begins counting down. After **1 hour (or another time frame set by the DM), it detonates in a 20-foot radius sphere, dealing **10d8 fire damage** (Dexterity saving throw DC 15 for half damage).
    
- **Trap Mechanism**  
    The explosion can be disarmed with a successful **DC 15 Arcana check** or **DC 18 Dexterity check** (using thieves' tools).
    
- **Devious Design**  
    The item is immune to damage and teleports back to the looter's bag if thrown away. Only dispelling magic (via **Dispel Magic** cast at 4th level or higher) can nullify its effects.
