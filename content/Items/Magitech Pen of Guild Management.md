_Wondrous Item, Common_

This unassuming yet highly versatile pen is an essential tool used by office workers and receptionists at guild halls. Crafted from a combination of enchanted metal and arcane circuitry, this pen is a perfect example of everyday Magitech used in administrative tasks.

**Functions:**

1. **Badge Scanning:** The pen can scan and verify Adventurer Guild badges with ease. When a badge is placed near the tip, it immediately reads and displays the adventurer’s status, including their rank, CP (Contribution Points), and quest history. The pen can update and change information on the badge by uploading data back to the central guild network.
    
2. **Camera and Recording:** At the pen’s tip is a miniature camera that can capture images, including of the adventurer's face for badge verification purposes, and even record brief videos for file uploads. It can store and send images or recordings directly to the guild database or a designated office workstation.
    
3. **Uploader and Data Syncing:** The pen has the ability to upload and sync all gathered information to the adventurer's badge. This includes quest completions, achievements, and updates in real-time. It ensures that any progress or information change is reflected immediately on the badge without the need for a manual update.
    
4. **Quest Tracker:** By using the pen to log specific details, it can update an adventurer's file during ongoing quests. This includes tracking quest progress, such as monster difficulties faced, challenges encountered, and any deviations from standard quest protocols. It can note changes like facing harder monsters or unexpected quest outcomes.
    
5. **Security Measures:** Only guild-approved staff can access certain features of the pen. The pen has built-in security protocols to prevent unauthorized use, ensuring that no one can tamper with or hack the system.
    

**Flaw:** The pen requires a continuous connection to the guild’s network to function properly. In the absence of this connection, the pen can only store a small amount of data for a short period, after which it will automatically sync when the connection is restored.
