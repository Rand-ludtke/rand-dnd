**Wondrous Item, Rare (requires attunement)**

---

**Description:**  
These goggles are crafted from brass and have a tinted glass lens over each eye, engraved with intricate runes of animal shapes. Soft, supple leather straps ensure a comfortable fit. When worn, they emit a faint glow, especially when their magical properties are activated.

**Properties:**

- **Shared Vision**: As an action, the wearer can activate the goggles to see through the eyes of an animal or familiar they have conscripted, summoned, or otherwise share a bond with. The animal must be within 1 mile of the wearer.
    
- **Duration and Limitations**: The shared vision lasts up to 10 minutes, and the wearer must maintain concentration as if concentrating on a spell. During this time, the wearer is blinded to their surroundings but can hear and see as if they were the animal, gaining the creatureâ€™s darkvision, enhanced senses, or other unique sight abilities.
    
- **Conscripted Sight**: The wearer can use an action to switch between their own vision and the creature's sight at will within the duration. They can also end the connection early as a bonus action.
    
- **Recharge**: Once used twice, the goggles regain their magic at dawn. Alternatively, the wearer can expend a 2nd-level spell slot to recharge them immediately.
    
- **Mental Link**: The wearer can communicate simple commands mentally to the conscripted animal during Shared Vision.
    


**Drawbacks:**

- **Strain of Shared Perception**: If the wearer takes damage while using Shared Vision, they must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw to maintain concentration. Failing the save ends the connection, and the wearer suffers from temporary visual disorientation, giving them disadvantage on Perception checks for 1 minute.
