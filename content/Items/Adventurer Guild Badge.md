_Wondrous Item, Common_

The **Adventurer Guild Badge** is an enchanted item given to all members of the Adventurers’ Guild. It serves as both a personal identifier and a real-time record of an adventurer’s achievements and status. The badge is typically worn on the chest or belt and can be accessed with a simple touch to reveal an adventurer's full profile.

**Key Features:**

1. **Image and Name:** The badge displays an image of the adventurer (stored via the guild's database) next to their name. This image updates automatically via the Magitech Pen, making it easy to identify an adventurer in guild offices or during official matters.
    
2. **Rank Indicator:** The color of the badge changes based on the adventurer’s rank:
    
    - **Bronze Rank:** A copper badge.
    - **Silver Rank:** A silver badge.
    - **Gold Rank:** A gold badge.
    - **Platinum Rank:** A platinum badge.
    
3. **Contribution Points (CP):** The badge displays the adventurer’s total Contribution Points (CP), which are earned through completing quests, assisting other adventurers, and making valuable contributions to the guild. CP is used to gauge an adventurer’s overall worth to the guild and can impact rewards, promotions, and quests available to the adventurer.
    
4. **Quest Tracking:** The badge keeps track of an adventurer’s current quests. Each quest entry includes:
    
    - **Quest Name**
    - **Status** (Accepted, In Progress, Completed, or Failed)
    - **Monsters Faced**
    - **Monsters Defeated**
    - **Additional Notes** (such as deviations from expected difficulty)
5. **Achievements:** The badge records well-known achievements, such as major victories, significant contributions to the guild, or accomplishments that have made the adventurer famous. It tracks specific milestones, like defeating powerful monsters or completing legendary quests.
    
6. **Dynamic Updates:** As the adventurer progresses through quests, earns CP, or gains new achievements, the badge updates in real-time via the Magitech Pen, reflecting the latest data gathered from completed quests and guild activities.

#### **Gold Rank Upgrades**

(Requires a Gold Rank Badge)  
Gold-ranked adventurers unlock more practical and advanced features for their badges.

1. **Personalized Map & Location Tracker:**
    
    - **Description:** The badge includes a mini-map feature that can display local areas, quest destinations, and even locations of specific interest. The map is interactive and can be updated in real-time to reflect changes in the terrain or new quests.
    - **Function:** When on the move, the badge provides a dynamic, personal map of nearby locations, tracking points of interest or quest objectives. It updates automatically as you travel, showing your current location in relation to guild hubs, quest objectives, and important landmarks.
2. **Call for Support:**
    
    - **Description:** Gold-ranked adventurers can call for backup from other guild members or a designated "guild support team." This feature is available for emergency situations, allowing the adventurer to request help when overwhelmed or in critical danger.
    - **Function:** Upon activation, the badge sends an emergency alert to the guild’s central command, which dispatches nearby guild members or automatically notifies a support team of healers, mages, or warriors to come to the adventurer's aid. This system operates similarly to an SOS signal, ensuring that help is on the way, even if the adventurer is deep in a dungeon or out on a remote mission.
3. **Enhanced Quest Details (Automatic Updates):**
    
    - **Description:** The badge now tracks quest progress in more detail, capturing significant changes in the mission’s status. It includes detailed notes about monster difficulty, rare resources found, and unexpected events.
    - **Function:** As the adventurer progresses through a quest, the badge provides updates on unforeseen challenges and alerts about monster difficulty scaling, offering insights like “Unexpected Elite Monster Encountered!” or “Rare Resource Discovered!” making it easier to track and report on the quest's dynamic elements.

#### **Platinum Rank Upgrades**

(Requires a Platinum Rank Badge)  
Platinum-ranked adventurers unlock truly exceptional capabilities with their badges.

1. **Instant Communication & Guild Chat:**
    
    - **Description:** The badge becomes a direct communication device that allows adventurers to stay in constant contact with guild members, even from distant or dangerous locations.
    - **Function:** The badge can send short-range telepathic messages to fellow guild members or use a magical interface to connect with a larger guild-wide chat system. This allows adventurers to communicate instantly with the guild, asking for advice, sharing information, or requesting backup without needing to rely on physical messaging systems. Additionally, when in a remote location, the badge can relay messages through arcane magic to ensure uninterrupted contact.
    
2. **Remote Portal Access (1x/day):**
    
    - **Description:** The badge grants the ability to access a teleportation portal that links directly to the guild’s main headquarters or a chosen safe zone (a guild-controlled safe house, for example).
    - **Function:** Once per day, the adventurer can activate the badge to teleport themselves to a predesignated location, typically a safe zone, guild headquarters, or a location where their guild has control. The portal lasts for one minute and can be used to escape dangerous situations or travel quickly between key guild locations.
    
3. **Guild-wide Alerts and Strategic Updates:**
    
    - **Description:** The badge provides an adventurer with real-time updates on guild-wide events, important alerts, and strategic information.
    - **Function:** Through this feature, the badge displays urgent alerts like new guild-wide events, high-priority quests, dangerous enemy movements, or major world events that could impact the guild's operations. It also gives access to the latest strategic reports, including the status of ongoing guild wars, critical developments, or changes in political power, allowing high-ranking adventurers to remain informed and prepared for any situation.
    
4. **Combat Assistance Mode:**
    
    - **Description:** The badge taps into the guild’s archives of combat knowledge to provide tactical advice in the heat of battle.
    - **Function:** When activated, the badge analyses the adventurer’s current situation and provides strategic advice. It can recommend spells, weapons, or tactics based on the adventurer’s current health, the type of enemies being faced, and other situational factors. The advice could include recommending specific magic items to use, advising on weaknesses of monsters, or even suggesting group formations for teamwork. This advice lasts for 10 minutes, after which the badge needs to recharge (can be used once per long rest).
