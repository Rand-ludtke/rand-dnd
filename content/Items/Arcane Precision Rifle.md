_Weapon (ranged firearm), legendary (requires attunement by a spellcaster)_

This sleek, high-tech rifle looks like a modern-day Barrett M82, made of a polished black metal with arcane symbols etched along its barrel. The stock is reinforced with a subtle yet intricate runic pattern that hums with power. The rifle's scope is a magical lens that allows the attuned user to focus their spells with incredible precision, making it an unparalleled tool for mages who wish to cast over long distances.

**Properties:**

- **Long Range Spellcasting:** The Arcane Precision Rifle functions as a spellcasting focus. When you make a ranged spell attack, you can use this rifle to increase the range of your spell by up to 300 feet (or to double the range if the spell already has a range of over 300 feet).
- **Long Shot, Heavy Disadvantage Close:** You gain advantage on ranged spell attacks/ impose disadvantage to targeted enemy for any spell save, made at a distance of 30 feet or more. However, when casting spells with the Arcane Precision Rifle within 30 feet of your target, you auto miss/ they auto pass the spell save.
- **Arcane Amplifier:** The rifle has a built-in magical amplifier that enhances the power of your spells. When you cast a spell through the rifle, you can expend a spell slot of 3rd level or higher to deal an additional 1d6 force damage per level of the expended spell slot.
- **Wind-up and Focus:** Before using the rifle, you must spend a bonus action to take a deep breath and focus on your target. On your next ranged spell attack, the attack deals an additional 1d6 force damage. This effect is consumed after one attack or can be recharged on the next turn.
- **Limited Ammunition:** The rifle requires specially crafted "arcane cartridges" to channel spells through it. You have 10 such cartridges, and they are restored after a long rest. If you run out, you cannot use the rifle until you acquire more.
- **Sonic Boom (1/day):** As an action, you can fire a powerful shot from the Arcane Precision Rifle that channels destructive energy. Choose one creature within 300 feet of you. The target must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC 15). On a failed save, the creature takes 8d6 force damage and is knocked prone. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage and is not knocked prone. After using this feature, you cannot use it again until you complete a long rest.

**Flaw:** Due to the immense power and sensitivity of the rifle, it is difficult to use in chaotic, close-quarters combat. The magic of the rifle is tuned to a narrow range, and casting within 30 feet of your target causes undue strain on the magic, leading to significant disadvantage on attacks.
