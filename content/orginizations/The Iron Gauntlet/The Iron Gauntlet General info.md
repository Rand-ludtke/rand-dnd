The Iron Gauntlet is a militant organization based in Steelwatch, Aynakyurt’s most defensible city. Initially established as a guard force for the kingdom, it has since expanded into an independent mercenary guild known for its discipline and military prowess. Members of the Iron Gauntlet are well-versed in combat, strategy, and tactics. They are often hired to defend key locations, escort important figures, and eliminate dangerous creatures that threaten the safety of the kingdoms. They are especially well-known for training monster hunters who seek to cleanse the southern wildlands of their dangerous beasts.
