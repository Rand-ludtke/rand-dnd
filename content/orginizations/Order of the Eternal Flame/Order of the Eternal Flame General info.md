Headquarters: Eldermount, in the eastern mountains of Eshlong 

Presence: Found in remote areas, hidden temples in mountainous regions, and secret sanctuaries across the three kingdoms 

Services: Protection against supernatural threats, sacred rites to contain ancient evils, magical fire-based rituals, and teaching flame-related spells. 

The Order of the Eternal Flame is a secretive organization devoted to containing ancient powers, specifically those related to fire and elemental chaos. Originating in the volcanic regions of the Desert of doom, the order protects the world from forgotten dangers that once threatened to consume it in fire and ruin. Their headquarters in Eldermount is shrouded in mystery, with only the highest-ranking members allowed access to its deepest chambers. The order also conducts intense rituals to guard over volcanic areas, preventing catastrophic eruptions. While their presence is scarce, their influence over the elemental forces makes them critical to the region’s stability. Those seeking to master fire magic often seek them out, though few are granted the knowledge they crave.
