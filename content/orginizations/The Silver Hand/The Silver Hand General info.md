The Silver Hand is an elite guild of spies and assassins that operates in the shadows, primarily within the Republic of Whirong. Their influence extends across all three kingdoms, as they work with politicians, merchants, and royalty to manipulate the delicate balance of power. While they are most commonly found in Whirong, where they serve the interests of the republic, the Silver Hand also maintains a network of informants and agents in every major city. Their services are highly coveted and come at a steep price. They are known for handling delicate political matters, gathering intelligence on potential threats, and eliminating those who pose a danger to the balance of power.
