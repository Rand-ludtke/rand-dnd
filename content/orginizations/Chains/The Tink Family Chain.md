### Family Dynamics and Traditions

The Tink family is bound by a tradition of exploration and invention, meeting annually for the **Tinkering Expo**. At this event, they present their latest creations, exchange ideas, and compete for the title of **Grand Tinkerer** (an award for the year's most creative invention). Known for their eccentric personalities, the Tinks take pride in oddities, especially those that serve no practical purpose but spark wonder.

They share an unspoken rivalry, each striving to outdo the others while holding an unbreakable family loyalty. Most Tinks are on friendly terms, but it's common for a playful grudge to linger over who "borrowed" whose blueprints last year.
