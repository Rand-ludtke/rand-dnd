### Known History

Elkian Sageheart and Ralofir Fallbreeze, both elves of extraordinary skill and valor, were once the most renowned pair of heroes in the land. Their exploits were celebrated in tales across the realms—fighting dark forces, saving villages, and protecting kingdoms. Elkian, a brilliant tactician and skilled magic user, and Ralofir, a swift and deadly warrior, became legends.

Their most dangerous quest was to confront the infamous necromancer, Markul, who had terrorized the world for decades. Alongside two other companions, they battled through legions of the undead to confront Markul himself.

In the climactic battle, Ralofir confronted Markul directly. Although they succeeded in defeating the necromancer, Ralofir was struck down in the process. His sacrifice became the stuff of legend, and Elkian, deeply affected by the loss of his closest companion, vowed to honor Ralofir’s memory.

In the years that followed, Elkian led his remaining companions on more adventures, but the void left by Ralofir's loss weighed heavily on him. Realizing they could not be everywhere, he founded an adventurers' guild to train others to carry on their legacy. Under Elkian's leadership, the guild flourished, gaining support from the three great kingdoms and becoming a powerful organization. He devised a ranking system, ensuring adventurers were recognized for their skills and accomplishments.

Despite the guild's successes, rumors of unrest have begun to surface. Dark forces seem to be stirring again, threatening the peace Elkian and Ralofir fought so hard to protect. Amid these tensions, whispers have begun to question the official story of Ralofir's death, suggesting that there may be more to the tale than what has been told.
