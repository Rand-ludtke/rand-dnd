### Appearance (Twisted Form)

- **Body:** A grotesque blend of draconic and unnatural elements. His scales are still **crimson**, but they shimmer with strange runes etched into his flesh. Some scales have **mutated**, giving off a blackened sheen.
- **Wings:** Elongated and ragged, with sinewy veins of magical energy running through them.
- **Eyes:** Glowing like molten lava but ringed with darkened, lifeless tissue—evidence of his dangerous experiments.
- **Horns:** Twisted unnaturally, curving in chaotic directions, as if his body was warped by volatile magic.
- **Aura:** Exudes a sense of overwhelming dread and power, as if his presence corrupts the space around him.

### Backstory

Sadrekkeor's descent into darkness began when his parents were killed by the necromancer Markul. Over centuries, he grew obsessed with gaining the strength to exact revenge, leading him to experiment on his own body and mind. These self-inflicted changes left him almost unrecognizable, but he saw them as necessary sacrifices for power.

He journeyed with Ralofir (Ghonfuligar) under new identities, gaining renown and allies. However, when they finally confronted Markul and witnessed the desecration of Sadrekkeor’s mother, his heart broke beyond repair. After killing Markul, Elkian's desire for control overtook his sense of justice, and he began plotting to rule over all creatures.

When Ralofir refused to join his vision of domination, Elkian betrayed him, plunging a blade through his friend and casting him into a canyon. Now, Elkian’s ambition knows no bounds—he believes that his twisted strength grants him the right to reshape the world as he sees fit.
