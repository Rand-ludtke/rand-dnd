**Race:** Centaur  
**Class:** Ranger (Beast Master)  
**Background:** Outlander
**Guild Role**: Vraeg works as a scout for the guild, using his connection with nature to track down threats before they reach populated areas. He is also responsible for leading guild expeditions into the wilderness and protecting the natural world.

### **Full Backstory**

- Vraeg was raised among a nomadic centaur tribe, learning the ways of the wild and forming strong bonds with nature and its creatures.
- When his homeland came under threat, Vraeg defended it fiercely, eventually crossing paths with **Elkian’s group**.
- Vraeg was impressed by Elkian’s tales of heroism and noble fights against evil, seeing him and **Ralofir** as paragons of justice.
- **However, Vraeg has started to notice cracks in Elkian’s façade**, sensing that there may be more to Elkian’s ambitions than what’s been revealed. Despite his suspicions, Vraeg remains loyal to the group, trusting that their ultimate mission aligns with his own goals of defending the natural world and its people.
- **Vraeg’s bond with nature** makes him a potential threat to Elkian if he ever learns the truth, but for now, his loyalty can be manipulated through promises of peace and protection for the wilds.
- **Backstory (Player Version)**: Vraeg grew up among a nomadic centaur tribe, where he formed a deep bond with nature. When his homeland came under threat, he became a defender of the wilds. He joined Elkian’s adventurers after hearing about their noble mission to rid the world of evil. 

**GM Information**: Vraeg is an invaluable asset due to his instincts and ability to navigate the wilds. However, his loyalty could waver if he uncovers the full extent of Elkian's plans for domination. For now, Elkian keeps him in the fold, manipulating Vraeg’s belief in their shared cause.
