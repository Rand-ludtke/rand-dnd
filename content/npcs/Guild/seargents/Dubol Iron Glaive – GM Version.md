**Name:** Dubol Iron Glaive  
**Race:** Orc (Female)  
**Class:** Fighter (Champion)  
**Background:** Outlander

### **Full Backstory**

- Dubol was raised in a nomadic orc tribe where strength equaled leadership, but constant infighting disillusioned her. She joined Elkian and Ralofir early in their adventures, drawn by their shared goal to **eliminate evil and bring order to the world**. However, as Elkian’s ideology shifted toward dominance, Dubol fully embraced it, believing **peace could only be achieved through absolute strength**.
- Dubol sees **Elkian’s vision of ruling the weak** as the logical conclusion of her warrior’s code. Under his leadership, she believes that the world will find the stability her tribe lacked.

### **Secret Influence and Current Role**

- Dubol **commands a secret nomadic orc band**, loyal only to her, which she can call upon for **missions in service of Sadrekkeor's plan for world domination**.
- In the guild, she acts as an **enforcer** and takes on covert missions—tasks that are too dangerous or morally questionable for regular adventurers.
- Dubol is aware of Rerdid’s **golem army project** and fully supports it, believing that such a force will ensure lasting peace. She sometimes **oversees bandit operations**, where the prototypes are tested, and **coordinates with pirate crews** to ensure the smooth flow of experimental weapons.
- Though she appears loyal to the guild, **her true loyalty lies with Elkian (Sadrekkeor)**, whom she sees as the only leader strong enough to unite the world.
