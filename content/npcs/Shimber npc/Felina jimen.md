## Description  
Felina is a whirlwind of energy, always on the move with a quill tucked behind her ear and ink smudges on her clothes. Her bunny ears twitch when she’s excited, which is most of the time. With her sparkling eyes and wide grin, Felina's curiosity knows no bounds. She loves a good scoop and will follow any lead, no matter how dangerous, if it promises a great story.  

Felina grew up in **Shakenkeep**, the daughter of **Garrith**, the local barkeep, who taught her how to navigate rough crowds and spot liars. Despite her lively nature, Felina can be remarkably shrewd when chasing down leads. Her dual heritage makes her stand out—a rarity in the city—but she embraces her uniqueness.
