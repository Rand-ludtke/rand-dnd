**Legendary Resistance (2/Day).** If Lysandra fails a saving throw, she can choose to succeed instead.

- **Moonlit Rapier.** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 12 (1d8 + 5) piercing damage plus 9 (2d8) necrotic damage.
- **Shadow Step.** As a bonus action, Lysandra teleports up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space she can see that is in dim light or darkness.
