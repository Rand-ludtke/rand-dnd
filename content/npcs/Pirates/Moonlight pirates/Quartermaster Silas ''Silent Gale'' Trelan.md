**Evasion.** If Silas is subjected to an effect that allows him to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, he instead takes no damage if he succeeds, and only half damage if he fails.

**Cunning Action.** Silas can take the Dash, Disengage, or Hide action as a bonus action on his turn.

**Actions**

- **Multiattack.** Silas makes two dagger attacks.
- **Dagger.** _Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack:_ +7 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 7 (1d6 + 4) piercing damage.
- **Silent Strike (Recharge 5–6).** Silas makes a melee attack. If it hits, the target takes an additional 18 (4d8) psychic damage and must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be paralyzed until the end of their next turn.

**Reactions**

- **Uncanny Dodge.** When an attacker that Silas can see hits him with an attack, he can use his reaction to halve the attack’s damage.
