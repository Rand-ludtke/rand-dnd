**LORE:**  
Elias “Coinkeeper” Brant managed the Silent Wave’s supplies and treasure. Known for his sharp mind and even sharper tongue, he kept the ship running smoothly and ensured every crew member had what they needed. He was also the moral compass for the crew, second only to Barbarossa herself. In death, Elias remains as resourceful as ever, conjuring ghostly supplies to aid his allies.
