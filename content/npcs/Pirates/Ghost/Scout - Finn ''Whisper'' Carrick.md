**Ghostly Step.** Finn can teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space he can see, passing through objects and creatures during this movement.

**Incorporeal Movement.** Finn can move through creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. He takes 5 (1d10) force damage if he ends his turn inside an object.

**Evasion.** When subjected to an effect that allows a Dexterity saving throw for half damage, Finn takes no damage on a success and half damage on a failure.

**LORE:**  
Finn was Barbarossa’s eyes and ears, an elusive scout who could disappear into the shadows at will. In undeath, his spectral form makes him an even more formidable infiltrator, silently gathering information for the crew.
