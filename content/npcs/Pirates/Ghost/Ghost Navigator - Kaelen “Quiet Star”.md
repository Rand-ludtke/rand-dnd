**TRAITS**

**Incorporeal Movement.** Kaelen can move through creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. He takes 5 (1d10) force damage if he ends his turn inside an object.

**Cartographer’s Foresight.** Kaelen has advantage on Survival checks to navigate or track and cannot become lost except by magical means.

**Tether to the Stars.** Kaelen can use the position of celestial bodies or arcane ley lines to orient himself and allies. While within 30 feet of Kaelen, friendly creatures have advantage on saving throws against effects that would alter their location, such as teleportation or banishment.

**Silent Watcher.** Kaelen’s presence is calming. Hostile creatures within 30 feet must succeed on a DC 14 Charisma saving throw or have disadvantage on attack rolls while Kaelen is not taking hostile actions.

**ACTIONS**

**Multiattack.** Kaelen makes two Ghostly Compass attacks or uses Astral Anchor.

**Ghostly Compass (Melee Weapon Attack).** _Attack Bonus:_ +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 15 (3d8 + 2) force damage.

**Astral Anchor (Recharge 5–6).** Kaelen summons a spectral anchor in a 20-foot radius centered on a point he can see within 60 feet. All creatures in the area must make a DC 16 Strength saving throw or be restrained for 1 minute. A restrained creature can use its action to make another Strength save, ending the effect on itself on a success.

Kaelen can take 2 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action can be used at a time, and only at the end of another creature's turn. He regains spent legendary actions at the start of his turn.

- **Compass Strike.** Kaelen makes one Ghostly Compass attack.
- **Spectral Map (Costs 2 Actions).** Kaelen projects a map of the area around him, granting allies within 30 feet 10 temporary hit points and advantage on their next attack roll.

**LORE:**  
Kaelen, known as "Quiet Star," was Barbarossa’s navigator and a master of celestial navigation. He was deeply protective of the crew and regarded as the calm voice of reason during storms and conflicts. His connection to Arlo was strong, teaching the young tiefling the art of mapmaking and navigation. In death, Kaelen’s quiet demeanor persists, as he continues to guide Barbarossa’s crew through the ethereal realms.
