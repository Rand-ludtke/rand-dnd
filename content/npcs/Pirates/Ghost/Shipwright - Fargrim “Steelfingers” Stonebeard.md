**LORE:**  
Fargrim “Steelfingers” was a master craftsman who kept the Silent Wave afloat through storms and battles. Gruff and unyielding, he had an almost mystical connection to the ship’s timbers and sails. In undeath, Fargrim’s expertise extends to repairing even the spectral hull of their ghostly vessel.
