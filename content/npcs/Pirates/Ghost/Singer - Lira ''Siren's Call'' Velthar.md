**TRAITS**

**Ethereal Harmony.** When Lira sings, her ghostly voice resonates with magic. Allies within 30 feet who can hear her gain advantage on saving throws against being frightened or charmed.

**Incorporeal Movement.** Lira can move through creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. She takes 5 (1d10) force damage if she ends her turn inside an object.

**Siren’s Charm.** As a bonus action, Lira can target one creature within 60 feet. The target must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or become charmed for 1 minute. The effect ends if the target takes damage.

**ACTIONS**

**Melodic Blast (Ranged Spell Attack).** _Attack Bonus:_ +8 to hit, range 60 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 18 (4d8) thunder damage.

**Haunting Refrain (Recharge 5–6).** Lira sings a ghostly song that forces all creatures within 30 feet to make a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, creatures take 27 (6d8) psychic damage and are frightened until the end of their next turn. On a success, they take half damage.

**LORE:**  
Lira was the ship’s soul, lifting spirits during long voyages with her enchanting voice. Her songs brought peace and camaraderie to the crew. Now, her spectral melodies haunt the waves, both soothing allies and unsettling foes.
