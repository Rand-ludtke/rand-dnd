**Commanding Presence.** Allies within 30 feet of Morganna gain advantage on saving throws against being frightened.

**Iron Resolve.** Once per turn, Morganna can choose to succeed on a failed saving throw.

**LORE:**  
Morganna, known as "Iron Vow," served as Barbarossa's right hand, maintaining discipline and ensuring the crew upheld the captain’s moral code. Fiercely loyal and unyielding, Morganna was both protector and enforcer aboard the Silent Wave. Her combat prowess and ability to inspire courage in her allies earned her respect and fear in equal measure. In undeath, Morganna’s resolve remains unbroken, and she fights with the same fiery determination she had in life.
