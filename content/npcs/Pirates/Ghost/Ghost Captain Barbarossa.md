**TRAITS**

**Incorporeal Movement.** Barbarossa can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. She takes 5 (1d10) force damage if she ends her turn inside an object.

**Aura of Command.** Friendly creatures within 30 feet of Barbarossa have advantage on attack rolls and saving throws against being frightened.

**Tactician's Insight (3/Day).** As a bonus action, Barbarossa can grant one ally she can see within 60 feet a reroll of an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw.

**Guardian of Sailors.** Barbarossa cannot harm creatures with the Sailor background or those who surrender willingly. She automatically knows when a creature is attempting to deceive her about their intent to surrender.

**Legends Live On.** When Barbarossa is reduced to 0 hit points, she can attempt to reform in 24 hours unless her remains (buried by Arlo on the deserted island) are sanctified with holy magic.

**ACTIONS**

**Multiattack.** Barbarossa makes three Ghostly Saber attacks or two Ghostly Pistol attacks.

**Ghostly Saber (Melee Weapon Attack).** _Attack Bonus:_ +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 17 (2d10 + 4) slashing damage plus 10 (3d6) radiant damage.

**Ghostly Pistol (Ranged Weapon Attack).** _Range:_ 60/240 ft. _Attack Bonus:_ +7 to hit, one target. _Hit:_ 20 (4d8) radiant damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or be blinded until the end of their next turn.

**Tidal Vengeance (Recharge 5–6).** Barbarossa summons spectral waves in a 30-foot radius centered on herself. Each creature of her choice in the area must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw, taking 36 (8d8) radiant damage on a failed save or half as much on a success. Creatures who fail are also pushed 20 feet away and knocked prone.

**LEGENDARY ACTIONS**  
Barbarossa can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action can be used at a time, and only at the end of another creature's turn. She regains spent legendary actions at the start of her turn.

- **Saber Strike.** Barbarossa makes one Ghostly Saber attack.
- **Spectral Rally (Costs 2 Actions).** Barbarossa calls on the spirits of her fallen crew to inspire her allies. All friendly creatures within 30 feet gain 10 temporary hit points.
- **Haunting Presence (Costs 3 Actions).** Barbarossa creates a ghostly image of her ship in a 60-foot radius. Hostile creatures in the area must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened for 1 minute. Creatures frightened this way take 14 (4d6) psychic damage at the start of their turns.

**LORE:**  
Barbarossa’s ghostly form has been drawn back into the mortal realm due to the chaotic magic unleashed by the Moonlight Pirates. She was known for her skill and honor, raiding large trade ships while sparing lives, earning both admiration and infamy across the seas. Her crew's fate was sealed in betrayal by a rival captain bolstered by dark powers (secretly backed by Sadrekkeor), though Barbarossa never compromised her principles.

In her spectral form, she is bound to protect the seas from those who exploit them unjustly. While her moral code prevents her from aiding the Moonlight Pirates, she has been known to guide those opposing them—though her assistance is tempered by her enduring sorrow and anger at her untimely death.
