**Race:** Elf (Male)  
**Role:** Head of the Seekers  
**Level:** 15-20  
**Personality:** Brilliant, aloof, and enigmatic, Telwyn has a reputation for being difficult to understand, even among his closest allies. Beneath his stoic exterior, however, lies a wanderer’s heart—a man with an insatiable curiosity for magic, knowledge, and the mysteries of the world.

Despite his prestigious position, Telwyn frequently sneaks away from his duties to explore ruins, chase legends, or indulge in earthly pleasures like music and good wine. His assistant is constantly frustrated by these escapades, but Telwyn's carefree attitude remains. He is deeply loyal to a handful of individuals, including his old friend Dwayne, a stone genasi he met during one of his wanderings.

### Key Relationships

- **Dwayne (Stone Genasi)**: One of Telwyn’s closest friends. They share a love for exploration, adventure, and occasional recklessness, much to the frustration of Telwyn’s assistant.
- **Assistant**: A diligent (and long-suffering) helper, constantly trying to keep Telwyn on task. Often frustrated by the archmage’s tendency to ignore his responsibilities.

### Abilities

- Master of complex and ancient magic.
- Renowned for his ability to uncover hidden truths.
- His approach to magic is creative, sometimes unconventional, which both impresses and unnerves those around him.

### Appearance

- **Face:** Angular and sharp, with high cheekbones and deep-set, bright **silver eyes** that always seem to be scanning beyond the present moment.
- **Hair:** Long, **pale blond hair** tied in a loose braid, though it often looks wind-tousled from his many adventures.
- **Clothing:** Telwyn wears an elegant, dark blue robe embroidered with **constellation patterns** in silver thread. He carries a **staff shaped like intertwined tree branches**, tipped with a faintly glowing crystal.
- **Demeanor:** His posture is relaxed, almost casual, in stark contrast to the weight of his title. A slight smirk often plays on his lips, hinting at some private amusement.
