**Race:** Tiefling (Female)

- Thira is descended from a little-known **shadow demon king**, which makes her lineage rare even among tieflings. Her features reflect a more eerie, ghostly quality compared to typical infernal traits.

### Appearance

- **Skin:** A muted, smoky **gray** with faint veins of shifting black that move subtly, like shadows under her skin.
- **Horns:** Thin and curved like a ram’s but trailing into wisps of shadow at the tips.
- **Eyes:** Solid **deep purple**, without pupils, giving her an unnerving, unreadable gaze.
- **Hair:** Long, sleek **black hair**, often tied in a bun, with occasional strands drifting as if caught in an invisible breeze.
- **Clothing:** Practical attire—dark trousers and a fitted coat, with a leather-bound journal at her side. She also wears a silver pendant etched with protective runes.
- **Demeanor:** Meticulous and serious, though she has a sharp wit that emerges when Telwyn pushes her patience too far. When stressed, the shadows around her horns grow darker, reflecting her emotional state.
### Personality

- Extremely organized and rule-abiding, which contrasts sharply with Telwyn’s chaotic tendencies.
- Often frustrated by Telwyn’s antics but remains fiercely loyal.
- Hides genuine admiration for Telwyn’s brilliance beneath their constant nagging.
- Has developed their own considerable magical talents, though they rarely receive credit for their efforts.

### Key Traits

- **Competent**, though underappreciated.
- **Stubborn**, especially when trying to wrangle Telwyn back into his role.
- **Caring**, though they rarely show it openly.
