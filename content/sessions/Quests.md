- Vernan approaches the party in a seaside tavern, offering a **sapphire worth 400 gold** if they purge the ship of its curse and retrieve the treasure from the captain's hold.
- **Insight DC 14**: Vernan is genuinely desperate but hides the fact that he’s been hearing whispers from the banshee captain in his dreams.

---

### **Quest Objectives**

1. Explore the _Stormcaller_ wreck, overcoming environmental hazards and ghostly apparitions.
2. Defeat the ghostly crew and the **Banshee Captain Nyra Stormsoul**, whose rage binds the ship’s curse.

---

### **The Wreck of the Stormcaller**

**Location**:  
The _Stormcaller_ is a massive, decaying shipwreck washed ashore on jagged rocks. Half of the ship is buried under sand, while the other half tilts at an ominous angle, creaking with every gust of wind. The storm seems unnaturally heavy around the wreck.

**Skill Checks for Exploration**:

1. **Navigating the Deck**:
    
    - Rotting wood makes the deck dangerous to traverse.
    - **Dexterity (Acrobatics) DC 13**: Avoid slipping through a weak section of the deck. Falling deals 2d6 bludgeoning damage as the character plummets into the lower hold.
2. **Collapsing Beams**:
    
    - **Perception DC 12**: Spot unstable support beams.
    - If a beam collapses: **Dexterity (Saving Throw) DC 14** or take 2d8 bludgeoning damage and become restrained under debris (requires a DC 15 Strength check to escape).
3. **Waterlogged Traps**:
    
    - Rusted mechanical traps set by smugglers lie in the cargo hold.
    - **Investigation DC 15**: Find the traps before triggering them. Failure causes a **spiked bear trap** to activate (1d10 piercing damage and grappled until freed).

---

### **Encounters**

#### **Ghostly Crew**

The spirits of the _Stormcaller_’s crew manifest as **specters**, driven mad by centuries of undeath. Each spirit still mimics its role aboard the ship.

    - **Specter (MM p. 279)** with the following changes:

        - **Personality**: Commands the other specters, barking ghostly orders.
- **Deckhand Karl Saltfoot**: A slow-moving, hunched ghost with barnacles growing out of his ethereal form.
    
    - Standard **Specter** with no changes.

#### **Banshee Captain Nyra Stormsoul**

**Description**: Nyra Stormsoul is a terrifying banshee whose beauty has decayed into a spectral visage of hatred. Her flowing hair seems to be made of storm clouds, and her voice echoes with the crashing of waves.

- **Banshee (MM p. 23)** with the following changes:
    
    - **Legendary Action**: _Storm’s Fury_ (Costs 2 actions)  
        Nyra conjures a violent storm of wind and saltwater. Each creature within 20 feet must make a **Strength (Saving Throw) DC 15** or be knocked prone and take **2d8 thunder damage**.
- **Combat Mechanics**:
    
    - Nyra uses her _Horrifying Visage_ to frighten the party and isolate weaker members.
    - She uses her _Wail_ as a devastating area attack when surrounded.

    - **100 gold coins** in a rotting chest.
    - **Ancient Nautical Map**: Leads to a hidden underwater vault, setting up a potential follow-up quest.

---

### **Twist**

After the banshee’s defeat, her spirit whispers:  
_"This curse cannot be broken… my master will rise again."_

The _Stormcaller_ was one of the ships in the fleet of the **Moonlight Pirates** (a key faction in your campaign), and the map points to one of their hidden lairs.
