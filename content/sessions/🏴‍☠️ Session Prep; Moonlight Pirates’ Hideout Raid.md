## **Session Overview**

- **Goal**: The party infiltrates the Moonlight Pirates' hideout at night, rescues Felina, uncovers evidence framing the dragon cult, and gains substantial loot.
- **Key Points**: Exploration of the hideout, stealth or combat options, Felina’s rescue, discovery of Sadrekkeor’s planted orders implicating the dragon cult, and treasure for the party.

---

## **1. Finding the Moonlight Pirates’ Hideout**

**Location**: A secluded, coastal cave network accessible only by a narrow waterway hidden within jagged cliffs.

**Ghost Ship’s Guidance**:

- As the moon rises, the ghost ship’s lanterns light a hidden path through the waves.
- The ghostly captain, a former ally of Arlo’s, guides the party to the cove’s entrance and reminds Arlo of the Sea Angel’s protection.

---

## **2. Infiltrating the Hideout**

**Entry and Navigation**:

- The hideout is well-guarded, with watch towers camouflaged in the cliffside. The party can choose between stealth and combat, using the ghost ship’s cover for entry.

**Stealth Option**:

- If the party moves quietly (Stealth checks DC 15), they can slip past the lookout towers and enter without alerting guards.

**Combat Option**:

- If detected, guards sound the alarm, and the party faces waves of defenders as they progress through the hideout.

## **6. Aftermath and Next Steps**

### Clues to Follow

- **Felina’s Intel**: Felina, once rested, shares that the pirates are becoming more aggressive under Sadrekkeor’s influence. She confirms hearing references to a “dragon cult” as the enemy in Sadrekkeor’s orders.
- **Burned Orders and Map**: The orders and map direct the party toward suspected cult sites southwest of Goldfall.

### Next Adventure Hook: Southwest Villages Investigation

With Felina safely returned, the party can investigate the villages where Sadrekkeor's planted clues suggest the dragon cult operates, setting up further misdirection. The map's general markings lead to four different villages, each with some signs of the cult but no solid proof, prolonging the mystery. This will bring them closer to discovering Sadrekkeor’s true intentions.

### **Felina’s Intel**

After Felina is rescued and has had time to rest, she shares valuable information:

- **Increasing Aggression**: Felina confirms that the pirates have become far more aggressive in recent months. This shift coincides with their increased use of advanced weaponry, magic items, and a ruthlessness that wasn’t present before. She doesn’t know the full extent of the change, but she’s sure it’s tied to a mysterious figure she’s only heard referred to as “The Boss.” This figure has become the driving force behind the pirates’ new tactics, with no mercy shown to any town or settlement they raid.
    
- **Mysterious Operations**:  Felina overheard pirates discussing an ongoing **operation** in a specific area that requires immediate attention. The pirates spoke in low voices, referring to the target of this operation as something that could “disrupt the balance” of their efforts. The pirates have been receiving orders to neutralize any potential threats in the region before they can establish a stronger presence.

### **Burned Orders and Map**

The players uncover the following fragments of orders and a damaged map in the **Captain’s Quarters**:

---

**Orders Snippets**:

1. **“Ensure all traces of their presence are erased.  activities in this area are becoming more frequent. Locations of interest must be identified and secured.”**
    
2. **“Scout and secure the area surrounding [location name].  infiltrate and assess the area.”**
    
3. **“ Secure all access points and neutralize any potential threats found in the vicinity.”**
    
4. **“Patrol routes around [location name] have been adjusted. Focus on securing any entry points and eliminating any signs of activity that could compromise the mission.”**
    
5. **“The hidden base near [location name] must be . Supplies are to be secured.  no survivors.”**
    

---

These orders, though cryptic, seem to suggest that a **hidden base** or **location of interest** is present in the area southwest of Goldfall. There’s no direct mention of a cult or their activities—only vague references to **securing the location** and eliminating potential threats. The goal seems to be surveillance and preparation for an eventual operation, but the orders don’t clarify who or what is being targeted. This leaves the players to assume they are investigating a hidden group, while the **true nature of the threat** (Sadrekkeor's pirates) remains concealed.

---

### **Insight Check**:

- **DC 14 Insight**: A successful check reveals that while the orders appear straightforward, there’s a subtle **sense of urgency** and a **strange attention to detail**. This indicates that the pirates are acting on a **clear directive from an outside force**. The mention of a **“hidden base”** and **“securing access points”** may suggest an organized, well-coordinated operation, but it’s still unclear who the target really is.

---

### **Damaged Map**

The map is burned around the edges, but enough is legible for the players to make out several markings. The map shows the area southwest of Goldfall, with a few specific locations circled or marked with symbols. There’s no direct reference to the cult or any specific group, but the symbols seem to indicate:

- **Several possible hideouts or bases** spread out across the area, each with unique symbols (perhaps resembling ruins, caves, or small villages).
- One of the locations is labeled **“Primary Base – Secure Access”** (though the surrounding details are burned away).
---

### **Key Points for the Party to Investigate**

- **Cult Deception**: The references to a “cult-like group” and “enemies of the cause” should direct the party's suspicions toward a religious or fanatical group. The deliberate omission of any specific name, such as “dragon cult,” ensures that the party is left to make assumptions based on the clues provided.
- **The Master’s Influence**: The orders refer to “The Master” or “The Benefactor” without ever naming him, maintaining the air of mystery and ensuring the players do not immediately connect the Moonlight Pirates’ benefactor with Sadrekkeor. This keeps the focus on the pirates’ mission to destroy a group that seems to be obstructing them, which ultimately sets the party on a false trail.
- **Ambiguous Symbols**: The map’s symbols are vague enough that, even after deciphering them, the players will think they’re heading toward a religious or fanatical cult hiding out in villages southwest of Goldfall. This keeps the party’s attention on the **cult**, leading them to the wrong conclusion that this group is the true enemy, rather than Sadrekkeor.
