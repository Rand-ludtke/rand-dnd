### **Room Details**

#### **1. A staff tucked under some debris**

- **Treasure**: _Staff of Withering_ (requires attunement, deals necrotic damage, and can reduce a target's Strength score).
- **Monster**: A _Bone Naga_ slithers nearby, protecting the staff. It was tasked to guard the staff centuries ago.
- **Trap**: Shifting the debris releases a cloud of poisonous gas (Constitution save or take poison damage).

---

#### **2. A rusty clockwork apparatus**

- **Feature**: Pulling the lever activates the clockwork, showing visions of a potential apocalypse—possibly caused by the Demon God’s return. The visions instill fear (Wisdom save or become frightened).
- **Monster**: A _Shadow Demon_ emerges from the shadows when the device is activated, attacking those it perceives as defiling the ruin.
- **Treasure**: A _Clockwork Pendant_ found near the apparatus. This magical item grants advantage on Arcana checks related to machinery or constructs.

#### **3. A fresco destroyed by gnoll vandals**

- **Monster**: A group of 3-5 _Gnoll Witherlings_ (undead gnolls) lingers in the area, gnawing on old bones.
- **Treasure**: A hidden compartment in the wall behind the fresco contains a _Potion of Superior Healing_ and 100 gp in ancient coins.

---

#### **4. A rotten locker containing a key**

- **Treasure**: The key unlocks the scorched door in Room 7. Additionally, the locker contains a _Bag of Tricks (Tan)_.
- **Trap**: Opening the locker without disarming it triggers a swarm of _Rot Grubs_, which attack the character who disturbed the locker.

---

#### **5. An old friend checking the contents of a trunk**

- **Feature**: The "old friend" is actually an _Incubus/Succubus_ in disguise, attempting to manipulate the party.
- **Treasure**: The trunk contains 2 _Spell Scrolls_ (_Dispel Magic_ and _Detect Magic_), along with a _Mithral Chain Shirt_.
- **Combat**: If the fiend's deception is discovered, it summons 2 _Quasits_ to aid in the fight.

---

#### **6. A chest with a mysterious, vibrating object**

- **Treasure**: Inside the chest is a _Heart of the Basilisk_, a pulsating organ that grants temporary petrification immunity when consumed (10 minutes) but causes a level of exhaustion.
- **Monster**: The chest is guarded by an _Otyugh_, attracted to the vibrations of the object and highly territorial.

---

#### **7. A scorched door with two keyholes**

- **Trap**: Attempting to unlock the door without the two keys (from Rooms 4 and 8) activates a magical fire trap (Dexterity save or take fire damage).
- **Monster**: Once the trap is triggered, a _Flame Skull_ animates and attacks.
- **Feature**: Behind the door is the entrance to the basilisk’s lair (Room 8).

---

#### **8. A key among rubble on the ground**

- **Trap**: Disturbing the rubble activates an _Earth Elemental_, which attacks intruders.
- **Treasure**: The key, along with a _Periapt of Wound Closure_, is hidden under the rubble.

---

### **Basilisk’s Lair (Optional Additional Room)**

- **Monster**: The _Undead Basilisk_ resides here, its petrifying gaze empowered by necrotic energy. It can petrify multiple creatures with a cone-shaped gaze attack (Con save).
- **Treasure**: The basilisk guards a pile of ancient loot, including:
    - 300 gp, 200 sp, and various gems (worth 150 gp total).
    - A _Cloak of Protection_.
    - A _Wand of Fear_.
