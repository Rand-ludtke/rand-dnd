## 🧭 Quest Overview

The adventurers’ guild dispatches the party to **Stormshore**, a coastal village plagued by recent disappearances of local fishermen. Strange lights flicker over the sea at night, and whispers among the villagers speak of an ancient curse tied to a **lost treasure** hidden in the nearby cove. The guild suspects a **dangerous sea serpent**, but some locals hint at an even more chilling presence—a ghost ship seen drifting silently in the fog.

## 🎯 Objectives

### 1. **Investigate the Disappearances**

The party can gather information from the villagers of Stormshore. Encourage roleplay with these NPCs:

- **Liana the Fisherwoman**: She lost her son to the sea a week ago. He disappeared after claiming he heard voices whispering to him about "the drowned treasure."
    
    - **Persuasion/Insight DC 12**: She reveals that he kept repeating “follow the light” before he disappeared.
- **Harlen the Merchant**: A trade shipment bound for Stormshore never arrived, and its last known position was near the haunted cove. Harlen offers a **50 gold reward** if the party recovers his wares, which include some valuable silks and rare herbs.
    
- **Old Barnum the Lighthouse Keeper** (now missing): Some villagers recall seeing Barnum heading to the **Stormshore Lighthouse** shortly before his disappearance. The lighthouse itself hasn’t worked in days, adding to the eeriness. If they investigate, they find **claw marks** near the door and signs of a struggle. A **DC 14 Investigation** check reveals Barnum’s torn satchel with a journal hinting at his fear of "dark shapes in the waves."

### 2. **Explore the Haunted Cove**

The party will locate the **haunted cove** based on the villagers' descriptions. The setting is eerie, filled with jagged rocks, mist, and the constant sound of waves crashing against the shore. The atmosphere is oppressive and damp, with an unnatural silence hanging over the area.

- **Ambush**: As they approach the cove, a group of **Sahuagin Scouts** lie in wait, sensing intruders.
    - **Stealth DC 15** to spot the Sahuagin before they strike.
    - **Sahuagin Scouts (2-4)**
        - **CR 1** each.
        - Special Ability: _Summon Reef Shark_ (recharge 5-6): Each Sahuagin can summon a reef shark from the nearby waters. Sharks can leap from the shallows to attack, adding pressure on the party.

**After the ambush**: The party discovers the **wreck of a large pirate ship** wedged between rocks in a hidden cave. The ship is decayed, but hints of its past grandeur linger.

#### **The Wreck Investigation**

The wrecked ship holds clues about the serpent and the treasure’s curse:

- **DC 13 Perception**: Noticing barnacle-covered runes on the deck.
    - These warn of an ancient curse binding anyone who dies on the ship to the serpent’s will.
- **DC 14 Arcana**: Recognizing the runes are connected to sea magic, warning that disturbing the treasure may wake “the Deep One.”
- **DC 15 Investigation**: Finding an intact chest near the ship’s hold with gold, gems, and remnants of the stolen trade shipment (Harlen’s silks and herbs).

### 3. **Boss Encounter: The Sea Serpent**

Deeper in the cave, the **Sea Serpent** lurks in a large tidal pool, guarding the cursed treasure. The serpent is ancient and infused with magic, and as soon as the party enters its lair, the creature awakens.

**Sea Serpent (Adult)**

- **CR 6**
- **HP**: 120
- **AC**: 16
- **Special Abilities**:
    - **Tidal Wave** (recharge 6): The serpent conjures a 10-foot-high wave of water, pushing back any creature within 30 feet. Each creature must make a **DC 14 Strength saving throw** or be knocked back 15 feet and take 2d8 bludgeoning damage.
    - **Mist Shroud** (recharge 5-6): The serpent can shroud the area in mist as a reaction. Any creature attacking the serpent has disadvantage on attacks until the start of the serpent’s next turn.

After a tense battle, the serpent is finally defeated, and the treasure is theirs. However, the party should be prepared for one last encounter…

### 4. **Eerie Departure**

As the party exits the cove, they spot a **ghostly fog** on the horizon. Within the mist is a **phantom ship**—silent, skeletal, and ominous—drifting across the water. It’s a ghostly reminder of the curse they just faced, hinting that darker forces may still be at work along the coast.

## 🪙 Treasure

The serpent’s lair contains a **pirate's hoard** scattered on the floor of the cave. The treasure is substantial but not enough to overwhelm the party’s wealth. The loot includes:

-- **Gold and Silver Coins**: 1000 gold pieces, 350 silver pieces, and assorted rare gems worth 200 gold each.
- **Tattered Maps**: A collection of faded maps detailing coastal trade routes and dangerous reefs, worth 100 gold to collectors.
- **Ship’s Log**: A weathered logbook containing cryptic entries, hinting at lost treasures on distant islands.
- **Fine Silk**: Several bales of high-quality silk (worth 250 gold total).
- **Pirate Captain’s Coat**: A richly decorated coat with silver buttons, worth 50 gold, though it’s quite worn.
- **Barrels of Exotic Spices**: A few barrels containing valuable spices worth 150 gold when sold.
- **Exquisite Cutlery Set**: A set of beautifully crafted eating utensils made of silver and adorned with intricate designs (worth 200 gold).
- **Sailor’s Chest**: Contains a mixture of clothing, personal trinkets, and two fine bottles of aged rum.
    
- **Magic Items**:
    
    1. [[Sokka's Boomerang]]
        
    
    2. **Sea Witch's Conch**
        
    3. **Lighthouse Keeper’s Lantern**
       
- **Reputation Boost**: The party earns their **rank-up** in the adventurers' guild, celebrated as protectors of Stormshore and welcomed with discounts on goods and safe lodging in town.

## 📜 Notes

**Future Hooks**:

- The **ghost ship** in the distance hints at deeper, supernatural forces lingering along the coast. Villagers claim it only appears before major storms, and those who see it say it’s crewed by the souls of sailors lost at sea. This could lead to a future encounter with the ship itself or another cursed sea-related quest.
