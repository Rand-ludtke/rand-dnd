## **Location Overview**

- **Isle of Shadows**: A small, remote island shrouded in constant mist, dense mangrove trees, and jagged, unnatural rock formations. Locals consider it cursed and avoid it, adding to its secrecy.
- **Whispering Cove**: Nestled within this hidden isle, the cove is fortified by treacherous reefs, stone pillars, and deadly shoals. The entrance is well-camouflaged by natural rock barriers and thick mangroves, accessible only by a winding, narrow passage. The eerie echoes that haunt the cove add an unnerving, ghostly atmosphere.

## **Notable Cove Features**

### 1. **Natural Camouflage and Narrow Entrance**

- **Description**: The only way into the cove is through a slim channel that weaves between razor-sharp rocks and shallow reefs, navigable only by small ships or boats that know the way.
    
- **Echoing Stones**: As the players enter, every sound reverberates, magnifying even whispers. These echoes make it easier for the pirates to detect intruders.
    
- **Mechanics**:
    
    - Stealth checks will be required frequently here as any misstep might cause sounds that alert nearby guards (DC 15).
    - Perception checks (DC 10) will allow the party to notice the slight movement and sounds of distant guards stationed on cliffs or in hidden recesses.

## **Escape from Whispering Cove**

As the players leave with Felina and their loot, the ghostly lights of Arlo’s former crew appear on the water, silently guiding the party back through the reefs. The ghostly figure of Arlo’s mentor captain stands at the prow of the ship, gesturing for Arlo to follow into the fog.
