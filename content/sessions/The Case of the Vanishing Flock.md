### Quest Outline

#### Step 1: Meeting the Quest Giver

**NPC**: _Halford Ternby_ - A weathered farmer in his late 50s, with a slight limp, a thick accent, and always wearing a wide-brimmed hat.

- **Description**: He’s distraught and skeptical, mumbling about “shady folk” or even “those blasted wolves.”
- **Information Given**: Halford explains he’s lost a sheep every other night for the past week. No signs of blood or wool, just empty spots where the animals were. He’s offered 300 GP to the Adventurers Guild to find out what’s happening.

**Clues Gained**:

1. Halford last saw one sheep vanish from the _north end of his pastures_, where the ground was disturbed.
2. He’s heard some _rumbling beneath the soil_ during the nights when the sheep disappeared.
3. _No other farmers nearby_ have had issues, which makes him think he’s being singled out.

#### Step 2: Investigating the Fields

_The party arrives at the fields, seeing the remnants of Halford’s flock grazing nervously._

- **Skill Checks**: Perception (DC 12) or Survival (DC 14).
    - Success reveals _disturbed earth and small burrow-like holes_ at the north edge of the field, though no clear footprints.
    - _Failed check_ results in no immediate clues, but players notice an unusual pattern in the disturbed soil (clues for the ankheg later).

**Clues Gained**:

1. Close inspection shows a faint acidic residue near the burrow holes. (Nature Check DC 15 reveals this might be from ankhegs.)
2. A few _small bones and bits of wool_ around the area seem to have a scorched or acidic quality.
3. Further investigation (DC 15) might reveal bits of _shell-like chitin_, indicating insectoid creatures.

_Upon investigating this area for 10 minutes or more, the players may experience slight tremors in the ground._

#### Step 3: Encountering Halford’s Neighbor

**NPC**: _Mira Oldbuck_ - A feisty halfling farmer who lives a short walk away from Halford.

- **Description**: Mira’s curious, skeptical of Halford’s “wolf theory,” and always has something to say. She’s seen something dart past her farmhouse at night but is certain it wasn't wolves.

**Clues Gained**:

1. Mira mentions she heard a strange “_scraping and scuttling sound_” last night, which stopped when she tried to investigate.
2. She saw “_something shimmer past her back window_,” which might indicate more than one creature.
3. She knows of an _old cave near the forest edge_, about half a mile northeast from Halford’s fields, where she’s seen creatures lurk before.

---

#### Step 4: Following the Trail to the Ankheg Lair

_The adventurers follow the path Mira suggested. As they get closer to the cave, signs of struggle and tracks become more evident._

- **Skill Checks**: Survival (DC 13) to follow faint drag marks and disturbed soil.
    - Success leads them to a small cave entrance near the forest’s edge.

**Details Inside the Cave**:

1. The initial tunnel is narrow but widens quickly, with small animal bones scattered around.
2. The walls show _acidic burn marks_ from ankheg spray and faint signs of struggle.
3. After advancing 30 feet, the party encounters **Darkmantles** clinging to the ceiling, poised to drop and ambush. _(2-3 Darkmantles)_

---

#### Step 5: The Ankheg’s Nest

_The tunnel widens into a cavern where the missing sheep are partially visible, cocooned in a hardened acidic shell._

- **Encounter**: _(2-3 Ankhegs)_ burrow up from the floor and walls to defend their nest.

**Treasure and Loot**:

1. A _Bag of Holding_ (contains a small hermit crab named “Chompy” who lives inside and defends his home by snapping at anything he doesn’t recognize).
2. _Cursed Boots of Walking_ - Once worn, they compel the wearer to keep walking, requiring a DC 16 Wisdom save to stop moving for any purpose.
3. A _rusted silver amulet_ in the shape of a star (non-magical but valuable, worth 50 GP).
4. _Ancient ankheg mandibles_ that can be sold for their value in alchemical components (worth 75 GP total).

_After dealing with the ankhegs, the adventurers can attempt to break the hardened shells around the sheep (Strength DC 13) to free what remains. Some sheep are salvageable, though a few may be lost._

---

### Conclusion

**Returning to Halford**: _When the adventurers return to Halford, he’s immensely grateful for any of his flock recovered. He pays the agreed-upon 300 GP but will insist that they take a few baskets of food from his farm as well._

**Reward**:

- 300 GP from Halford, plus any loot from the cave.
