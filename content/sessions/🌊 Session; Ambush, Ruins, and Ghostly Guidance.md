## **Session Overview**

- **Goal**: Challenge the party with a rogue-targeted ambush, a detailed investigation of the destroyed town of Skelheim, and a mysterious call for Arlo. The ghost ship will appear as a last-minute aid in a sea battle with the Moonlight Pirates.
- **Key Points**: Ambush encounter, investigation in Skelheim, supernatural guidance, sea battle setup, and first encounter with the ghost ship.

## **1. En Route Ambush: Master Assassin Attack**

**Location**: A forested clearing on the road to Angel’s Fall  
**Objective**: The party’s rogue is specifically targeted in a nighttime ambush by an elite assassin employed by the Moonlight Pirates.

- **Master Assassin**: Name: **Sable Thornblade**
    - **Appearance**: Cloaked in dark leather armor, wearing a half-mask, wielding dual daggers coated in poison. He has smoke bombs and an array of vials for quick escapes.
    - **Abilities**: Skilled in stealth and high-level rogue abilities like _Uncanny Dodge_, _Evasion_, and _Sneak Attack_.

### Encounter Mechanics

- **Initiation**: Sable silently approaches the camp. Players can make a Perception check (DC 16) to spot Sable’s approach, especially if the rogue is on watch.
    - **Success**: The party spots Sable sneaking up, allowing them to react without a _Surprise Round_. If failed, Sable attacks the rogue with advantage, aiming for maximum damage.
    - **Smoke Bombs**: Sable throws a smoke bomb (use _Fog Cloud_ mechanics) to create chaos if cornered, giving him an advantage to escape if necessary.

### Key Drops

- **Clues Left Behind**: If Sable escapes or is defeated, he leaves a **Black Feather with a Red Thread** around it—a subtle hint of the Moonlight Pirates’ involvement, as their crew members often mark themselves with similar symbols.

## **2. Arrival in Angel's Fall: Tense Atmosphere and Key Information**

**Location**: The coastal town of Angel’s Fall  
**Objective**: The party learns about the destruction of Skelheim, finds out Felina was in that town, and hears about ghost ship sightings.

### Key NPC Interactions

- **Abbey Members**: The paladins and clergy of the Sea Angel express unease about the increase in violence and the devastating pirate attacks. Some paladins are preparing for an expedition to investigate Skelheim.
	
- **History Check (DC 12)**: Identifies that these paladins, like Arlo, have ties to sacred vengeance and the Sea Angel, creating a spiritual connection to the ghostly events tied to Skelheim.
	
- **Town Crier in Market Square**: A shaken young man, loudly announcing Skelheim’s destruction.
	
- **Details on the Attack**: Mentions rumors that the Moonlight Pirates attacked at night, leaving no one alive. He stumbles over mentioning “one survivor”—but then says Felina’s name quietly, indicating her connection.
	
- **Sailors at The Docks**: They nervously discuss rumors of a ghostly ship that’s been spotted off the coast, saying it’s an omen tied to death and vengeance.
	
### Insight Checks

- **Insight Check (DC 14)**: Detects that some older sailors might know more about the ghost ship’s legend but are unwilling to speak openly. With persuasion, they reveal that the ghost ship resembles one from old tales associated with vengeance and the Sea Angel’s justice.

## **3. Investigation of Skelheim’s Ruins**

**Location**: The destroyed town of Skelheim, now a lifeless and eerie shell  
**Objective**: Uncover clues about the attack and Felina’s fate, revealing evidence of the Moonlight Pirates’ cruelty and traces of the supernatural.

### Setting the Scene

- **Sensory Detail**: A smoky haze lingers, and the air smells of salt and ash. Half-collapsed structures stand as grim silhouettes against the horizon, while the sound of waves adds a mournful background.
- **Atmosphere**: Scattered debris, burned furniture, broken household items, and faint tracks create an ominous scene.

### Investigation Clues and Checks

#### **1. Felina’s Last Known Location (The Broken Chalice Inn)**

- **Investigation Check (DC 12)**: Finds remnants of the inn’s furniture overturned, bloodstains near the door, and a broken chair leg that looks like it was used as a weapon.
- **Perception Check (DC 15)**: Under a pile of ash near the bar, players can spot a distinctive pendant belonging to Felina—signifying that she was here and might have struggled with her attackers.
- **Insight Check (DC 13)**: Recognizes signs of a desperate struggle, implying that she might have been dragged out against her will, leaving behind this small but crucial clue.

#### **2. Beachfront and Pirate Landing Point**

- **Survival Check (DC 14)**: Detects several sets of boot prints along the sand and drag marks leading to the water’s edge, where a boat must have docked.
- **Investigation Check (DC 12)**: Finds a fragment of black cloth with a tiny moon-shaped symbol embroidered in silver, a subtle insignia of the Moonlight Pirates.

#### **3. The Church and Homes**

- **Investigation Check (DC 10)**: Inside the small, burnt-out church, players find symbols of the Sea Angel defaced, with dark, taunting symbols carved over them, clearly left by the Moonlight Pirates.
- **Religion Check (DC 14)**: Recognizes these carvings as marks of desecration, likely intended to provoke followers of the Sea Angel.

### Clues of Supernatural Activity

- As they leave the town, a faint chill permeates the air, and Arlo feels an instinctive pull, as though something beckons him from the shoreline. This subtle connection to the Sea Angel seems to resonate as he nears the water.

## **4. The Call to Arlo**

**Location**: Shoreline, on the outskirts of Skelheim  
**Objective**: Arlo senses a supernatural call from the Sea Angel’s spirit, which will lead him and the party toward the Moonlight Pirates at sea.

- **Event Description**: At dusk, Arlo hears a faint, almost inaudible whisper calling his name, tugging at his soul. He can feel the presence of something tied to his past, something urging him to set out to sea.
    
    - **Insight Check (DC 12)**: Reveals that this call feels familiar and is somehow connected to the Sea Angel, aligning with Arlo’s divine connection.
    - **Religion Check (DC 15)**: If successful, Arlo intuits that the Sea Angel or a related spirit may be guiding him toward something important.
- **Guidance for the Paladin Pirates**: Arlo’s pull convinces the paladin pirates to prepare for a journey out to sea, hoping to intercept the Moonlight Pirates’ path. They agree to let Arlo and his party join as they investigate further.

- **Moonlight Pirate Ship**: Outfitted with magical cannons, mechanical constructs, and arcane defenses, giving them a technological advantage.
- **Moonlight Pirate Crew**: Skilled in naval combat, with spellcasters and golem-enforced infantry ready to repel attackers. They aim to hold off the players, capture Felina if possible, and escape using a teleportation spell.

#### Battle Mechanics

- **Special Attacks**:
    - **Enchanted Cannons**: Roll d20s with +5 to hit for cannon fire. Players must make Dexterity Saves (DC 14) to avoid being knocked back by cannon blasts.

### Ghost Ship's Last-Minute Intervention

    - **Ghostly Effects**: The ship’s spectral cannons fire at the Moonlight Pirates, evening the odds and giving players advantage on their next attack rolls.
    - **Fear Effect**: The ghost ship's presence causes a fear effect for any Moonlight Pirates within 30 feet (DC 13 Wisdom save).
