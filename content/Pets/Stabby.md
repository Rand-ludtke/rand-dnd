**Traits:**

- **Evasion.** If the sentient rapier is subjected to an effect that allows it to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, it takes no damage if it succeeds on the saving throw.
    
- _**False Appearance** While the sword remains motionless and isn't flying, it is indistinguishable from a normal sword.
    
- **Flying Companion.** The rapier can hover in place and has a flying speed of 60 feet. It can use its movement to help its owner by distracting enemies or delivering small items.
    

**Actions:**

- **Slash.** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 6 (1d8 + 2) slashing damage. The rapier can use this attack while flying or hovering next to its owner.
    
- **Help Action.** As a bonus action, the rapier can use the Help action to grant advantage on the next attack roll made by its owner against a creature within 5 feet of it.
    
- **Blade Dance (Recharge 5-6).** The rapier performs a dazzling display of spinning and dancing movements. Each creature of the rapier’s choice within 10 feet must make a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a creature is charmed until the end of its next turn and cannot take hostile actions against the rapier or its owner. On a successful save, a creature is immune to this effect for 24 hours.
