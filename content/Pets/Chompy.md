## Description

Chompy is a hermit crab(maybe?) who has made an unlikely home inside a bag of holding, where he seems quite content despite the strange, extradimensional habitat. His shell is adorned with bits of shiny objects that he has gathered over time, and he’s known to be both stubborn and curious, often investigating anything new that’s placed in the bag.

## Personality

- **Curious and Adventurous**: Chompy isn’t easily startled and seems interested in anything placed inside the bag.
- **Food Motivated**: He loves bits of food that make their way into his domain, especially pieces of dried meat and hardtack.
- **Protective of His Home**: Chompy is highly territorial and will sometimes pinch unfamiliar hands or items that seem to invade his space.

## Background

The origins of Chompy's residence in the bag of holding are unknown, but he may have slipped in during a beach expedition or through a mishap at a coastal market. He’s been with the adventuring party for some time, quietly collecting tiny trinkets and shiny bits in his corner of the bag.

## Abilities

- **Item Sifting**: Chompy has a knack for locating small, shiny objects within the bag. He may bring up useful or forgotten items if coaxed with food.
- **Pinch Attack**: If disturbed, Chompy will pinch anything within reach. It deals minimal damage (1 point), but it’s effective at startling any intruder.
- **Bag Sense**: Somehow, Chompy is aware of changes within the bag of holding, especially when new items are added or removed.
