### Traits

**Nimble Escape.** Steve can take the Disengage or Hide action as a bonus action on each of his turns.

**Unpredictable Age.** Steve has lived "between 1 and 20 years," as no one can agree on his age, including him. He occasionally drops nonsensical or contradictory hints about his life that confuse enemies (and allies). Once per short rest, Steve can force a creature within 30 feet to make a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, the creature is _distracted_ until the end of Steve's next turn, giving disadvantage on the creature’s next attack roll.

**Throw Sand (Recharge 5-6).** Steve tosses a handful of sand or dirt into a creature’s eyes. The target must succeed on a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw or be _blinded_ until the end of Steve's next turn.

### Description

Steve is a scrappy, sarcastic goblin who enjoys stealing trinkets, telling tall tales, and confusing anyone who asks about his past. Despite his chaotic nature, he has a knack for charming (or annoying) his way out of trouble. Steve's leather armor is patched together with random scraps, and his oversized boots make a _clomp-clomp_ sound when he walks.

Although he prefers to avoid direct confrontations, Steve has a surprising streak of bravery when his friends are in danger—or when treasure is involved.

He also may or may not be the Dm's Dad...
