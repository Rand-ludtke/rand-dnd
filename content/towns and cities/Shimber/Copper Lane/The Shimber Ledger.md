## Flavor  
- The printing press hums loudly in the back, with papers flying off the machine and ink stains everywhere.  
- Felina often bursts through the door with wild, breathless excitement, throwing notes onto Oswald's desk.  
- Rumor has it that some adventurers bribe Mavis to get sensitive information before it’s printed.
