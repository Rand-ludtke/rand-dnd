## Flavor

- The animal care facility is large and smells of hay, leather, and various creatures. Borin Ironhoof can often be seen whispering to massive, exotic mounts, while Lila tends to the smaller creatures with care and expertise.
- Adventurers often leave their trusted companions here while on dangerous quests, knowing they will be well cared for.
