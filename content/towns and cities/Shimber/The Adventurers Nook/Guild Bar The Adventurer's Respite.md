## Flavor

- The bar is lively, with adventurers swapping stories of their latest quests. Jak Steelhand mans the bar with efficiency, while the smell of food and the clink of mugs fills the air.
- A notice board near the entrance often has small quests or challenges, like “Drink a Dragon’s Breath in one gulp!”
