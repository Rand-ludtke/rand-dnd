# Weapon Enchantments
 
## Certain Death

- Requirements: Any weapon.
- Price: 5000gp
- Original Source: The 'Weapon of Certain Death' item from _Explorer's Guide to Wildemount_ (pg 270)

Effect: Whenever damage is dealt with this weapon, the target cannot regain hit points until the start of the wielders next turn.

## Corpse Slayer

- Requirements: Any +1 (or higher) weapon, requires attunement
- Price: 4000gp
- Original Source: The 'Corpse Slayer' items from _Explorer's Guide to Wildemount_ (pg 266)

Effect: When you hit an undead creature with an attack using this weapon, the attack deals an extra 1d8 damage of the weapon’s type, and the creature has disadvantage on saving throws against effects that turn undead until the start of your next turn.

Undead creatures that are normally immune to Turn Undead effects lose that immunity, but roll with advantage. 

## Cutting Edge

- Requirements: A weapon that deals Slashing damage, requires attunement.
- Price: 1700gp
- Original Source: 'Sword of Sharpness' from _Dungeon Masters Guide_ (pg 206)

Effect: When you attack an object with this magic weapon and hit, maximize your weapon damage dice against the target.

When you attack a creature with this weapon and roll a 20 on the attack roll, that target takes an extra 4d6 slashing damage.

On a critical hit, roll a Dexterity check against the targets AC - if you beat it, you sever one of the targets limbs, assuming it has any.

In addition, you can speak the sword's command word to cause the blade to shed bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet. Speaking the command word again or sheathing the sword puts out the light.

## Dancing Weapon

- Requirements: Any weapon, requires attunement.
- Price: 2000gp
- Original Source: 'Dancing Sword' from _Dungeon Masters Guide_ (pg 161)

Effect: You can use a bonus action to toss this magic sword into the air and speak the command word. When you do so, the weapon begins to hover, flies up to 30 feet, and attacks one creature of your choice within 5 feet of it. The weapon uses your attack roll and ability score modifier to damage rolls.

While the weapon hovers, you can use a bonus action to cause it to fly up to 30 feet to another spot within 30 feet of you. As part of the same bonus action, you can cause the weapon to attack one creature within 5 feet of it.

After the hovering weapon attacks for the fourth time, it flies up to 30 feet and tries to return to your hand. If you have no hand free, it falls to the ground at your feet. If the weapon has no unobstructed path to you, it moves as close to you as it can and then falls to the ground. It also ceases to hover if you grasp it or move more than 30 feet away from it.

## Defender

- Requirements: Any +3 Weapon, requires attunement
- Price: 24000gp
- Original Source: 'Defender' from _Basic Rules_ (pg 164)

Effect: The first time you attack with this weapon on each of your turns, you can transfer some or all of the weapon's bonus to your Armor Class, instead of using the bonus on any attacks that turn. For example, you could reduce the bonus to your attack and damage rolls to +1 and gain a +2 bonus to AC. The adjusted bonuses remain in effect until the start of your next turn, although you must hold the weapon to gain a bonus to AC from it.

## Dragon Slayer

- Requirements: Any +1 (or higher) weapon, requires attunement 
- Price: 4000gp
- Original Source: 'Dragon Slayer' weapons from _Basic Rules_ (pg 166)

- Original Source: The 'Flame Tongue Sword' weapons from _Dungeon Master's Guide_ (pg 170)

Effect: You can use a bonus action to speak this magic weapon's command word, causing flames to erupt from it. These flames shed bright light in a 40-foot radius and dim light for an additional 40 feet. While the weapon is ablaze, it deals an extra 2d6 fire damage to any target it hits. The flames last until you use a bonus action to speak the command word again or until you drop or sheathe the weapon.

## Frost Brand

- Requirements: Any weapon that deals Bludgeoning or Piercing damage, requires attunement.
- Price: 5000gp
- Original Source: The 'Frost Brand' weapons from _Basic Rules_ (pg 171)

In freezing temperatures, the weapon sheds bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet.

When you draw this weapon, you can extinguish all non-magical flames within 30 feet of you. This property can be used no more than once per hour. 

## Giant Slayer

- Price: 4000gp
- Original Source: 'Giant Slayer' weapons from _Dungeon Master's Guide_ (pg 172)

Effect: Whenever this weapon damages a 'Giant' type creature, or a 'Beast' type creature with the word 'giant' in its true name, it deals an extra 2D6 damage. In addition, the target must succeed on a DC15 Strength saving throw or fall prone.

## Holy Avenger

- Requirements: Any +3 Weapon, requires attunement
- Price: 115,000gp
- Original Source: The 'Holy Avenger' weapons from _Basic Rules_ (pg 174)

Effect: You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. When you hit a fiend or an undead with it, that creature takes an extra 2d10 radiant damage.

While you hold the drawn sword, it creates an aura in a 10-foot radius around you. You and all creatures friendly to you in the aura have advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects. If you have 17 or more levels in the paladin class, the radius of the aura increases to 30 feet.

- Requirements: Any +1 (or higher) weapon, requires attunement
- Price: 4000gp
- Original Source: The 'Luck Blade' weapons from _Dungeon Masters Guide_ (pg 179)

If the weapon is on your person and you are attuned to it, you can call on its luck (no action required) to reroll one attack roll, ability check, or saving throw you dislike. You must use the second roll. This property can't be used again until the next dawn.

## Moon-Touched

## Nine Lives Stealer

- Requirements: Any +2 (or higher) weapon, requires attunement
- Price: 3000
- Original Source: The 'Nine Lives Stealer' weapons from _Dungeon Master's Guide_ (pg 183)

Effect: The weapon has 9 charges. If you score a critical hit against a creature that has fewer than 100 hit points, it must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be slain instantly as the weapon tears its life force from its body (a construct or an undead is immune). The weapon loses 1 charge if the creature is slain. When the weapon has no charges remaining, it loses this property, but remains a +2 magic weapon. 

## Riptide

- Requirements: Any weapon the deals slashing damage.
- Price: 100gp
- Original Source: Inspired by the 'Fishfolk' weapons created by homebrewer 'Loot Tavern'. Also inspired by the enchantment of the same name in Minecraft.

Effect: Riptide allows a weapon to be used as effectively in water as it is on land. While attacking in water or underwater, attacks with this weapon do not suffer disadvantage. Any and all other conditions of water combat still apply. 

## Terror

- Requirements: Any weapon, requires attunement.
- Price: 8000gp
- Original Source: The 'Mace of Terror' item in _Dungeon Master's Guide_ (pg 180)

Effect: This magic weapon has 3 charges. While holding it, you can use an action and expend 1 charge to release a wave of terror. Each creature of your choice in a 30-foot radius extending from you must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of you for 1 minute. The effect ends early if the wielder of this weapon is disarmed or rendered incapacitated. 

While it is frightened in this way, a creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can't willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can't take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If it has nowhere it can move, the creature can use the Dodge action. At the end of each of its turns, a creature can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.

The weapon regains 1 expend charge daily at dawn.

## Venom

- Requirements: Any +1 (or higher) weapon that has 'Finesse' or 'Light' properties, and deals Slashing or Piercing damage
- Price: 1500gp
- Original Source: The 'Dagger of Venom' weapon from _Dungeon Master's Guide_ (pg 161)

Effect: You can use an action to cause thick, black poison to coat the blade. The poison remains for 1 minute or until an attack using this weapon hits a creature. That creature must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take 2d10 poison damage and become poisoned for 1 minute. The dagger can't be used this way again until the next dawn.

## Vicious Weapon

- Requirements: Any weapon.
- Price: 350gp
- Original Source: The 'Vicious Weapon' item from _Dungeon Master's Guide_ (pg 209)

Effect: When attacking with this weapon, on a Natural 20, this weapon does an extra 2D6 of damage on top of the standard critical damage increase. 

## Vorpal

- Requirements: Any +3 Weapon that deals Slashing damage, requires attunement.
- Price: 24,000gp
- Original Source: The 'Vorpal Sword' item from _Dungeon Master's Guide_ (pg 209)

Effect: This weapon ignores resistance to slashing damage. When you attack a creature that has at least one head with this weapon and roll a 20 on the attack roll, you cut off one of the creature's heads. The creature dies if it can't survive without the lost head. A creature is immune to this effect if it is immune to slashing damage, doesn't have or need a head, has legendary actions, or the GM decides that the creature is too big for its head to be cut off with this weapon. Such a creature instead takes an extra 6d8 slashing damage from the hit.

## Warning

- Requirements: Any weapon, requires attunement
- Price: 500gp
- Original Source: The 'Weapon of Warning' item in _Dungeon Master's Guide_ (pg 213)

Effect: This magic weapon warns you of danger. While the weapon is on your person, you have advantage on initiative rolls. In addition, you and any of your companions within 30 feet of you can’t be surprised, except when incapacitated by something other than nonmagical sleep. The weapon magically awakens you and your companions within range if any of you are sleeping naturally when combat begins.

## Wounding

- Requirements: Any weapon, requires attunement
- Price: 2000
- Original Source: The 'Sword of Wounding' item from _Dungeon Master's Guide_ (pg 209)

Effect: Hit points lost to this weapon's damage can be regained only through a short or long rest, rather than by regeneration, magic, or any other means.

Once per turn, when you hit a creature with an attack using this magic weapon, you can wound the target. At the start of each of the wounded creature's turns, it takes 1d4 necrotic damage for each time you've wounded it, and it can then make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, ending the effect of all such wounds on itself on a success. Alternatively, the wounded creature, or a creature within 5 feet of it, can use an action to make a DC 15 Wisdom (Medicine) check, ending the effect of such wounds on it on a success.

## Last Stand

- Requirements: Any +1 (or higher) armour, requires attunement.
- Price: 45,000gp
- Original Source: The 'Last Stand Armor' from _Explorer's Guide to Wildemount_ (pg 267)

Effect: This armour shimmers faintly with arcane armour whenever it is attuned and worn. If you die while wearing the armour, it is destroyed, and all creatures within 30ft. of it must succeed on a DC15 Charisma saving throw or be banished, as though by the _Banishment_ spell.

You can pre-emptively render someone immune to this effect by allowing them to lay a hand (or other limb) upon you while you're wearing the armour, and consciously adding them to your attunement. In combat, this takes their action and your reaction.

Effect: Wisps of harmless, odorless smoke rise from this armor while it is worn.

# Shields
