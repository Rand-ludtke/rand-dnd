### Description

Stormshore is a small, salt-sprayed town perched on the edge of rugged cliffs overlooking the sea. Known for its hardworking fishermen and the endless roar of waves, it’s a close-knit community where everyone knows each other. The town has a practical, weathered look, with buildings built to withstand the frequent storms that give the town its name. Residents rely on the sea for sustenance, trade, and superstition; they hold regular offerings to the Sea Angel and other sea spirits in hopes of calm waters and bountiful catches.

#### Notable Features

- **Fishing Docks:** The heart of Stormshore’s livelihood, where fishing boats come and go, selling their catch daily.
- **Rocky Cliffs:** A natural barrier from the sea, and a favorite lookout spot for watching the waves crash below.
- **Sea Angel Shrine:** A small, humble shrine to the Sea Angel on the far end of the docks, where fishers leave offerings before heading out.
