**Overview**  
Angel’s Fall is a coastal town known for its devotion to the Sea Angel, a powerful but distant god primarily worshipped by vengeance paladins. The town has a distinct Spanish influence, visible in the names and culture. The Sea Angel is known for empowering followers without frequent communication or guidance, leaving its paladins to seek and fulfill sacred vengeance on their own terms.

**Symbol**  
The Sea Angel’s symbol is a sea angel crafted from glass or metal, a simple but powerful reminder of its mysterious nature. Shrines with this symbol can occasionally be found in other coastal villages, though full worship centers are rare outside Angel's Fall.

**Customs**  
When a sacred target is defeated, followers deliver the body, or at least a small piece such as a lock of hair or vial of blood, to the water for the Sea Angel to "consume" the soul.
