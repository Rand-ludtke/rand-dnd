**Overview**  
The Coastal Shrine of the Sea Angel sits on a cliff overlooking the ocean. Its design is simple yet beautiful, featuring a polished metal statue of a sea angel. This shrine is a quieter, more isolated place than the abbey, often visited by travelers, sailors, and townsfolk who offer prayers for protection or vengeance.

**Customs and Rituals**

- **Offerings**: Pilgrims often leave locks of hair or small vials of blood from enemies or even sea creatures, praying for the Sea Angel’s blessing.
- **Vigil Nights**: On certain moonlit nights, vengeance paladins gather to meditate, seeking the Sea Angel’s strength for upcoming battles.

**Shrine Caretaker**  
An elderly woman named Pilar tends to the shrine, welcoming worshippers and ensuring the site remains undisturbed by the elements. She knows countless stories about the Sea Angel and is willing to share them with those who seek its favor.
