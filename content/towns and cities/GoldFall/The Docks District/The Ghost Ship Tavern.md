## Flavor

- The tavern is dimly lit, with flickering lanterns hanging from the walls, and the air is thick with the smell of mildew and salt. The wooden beams creak as if the ship itself is still alive.
- The walls are adorned with faded portraits of sailors, and some patrons swear they have seen the portraits' eyes move when no one is looking.

## Rumors

- It’s said that the Ghost Ship Tavern was once a real ship, cursed to sail the seas for eternity after its captain made a deal with a sea god.
- Aris Dreadbottle is rumored to have known the captain in life and that she is the only one who knows how to break the curse—though she’s tight-lipped about it.
- Some sailors claim that if you drink enough of the Ghostly Grog, you’ll be able to hear the ship’s crew calling from the depths of the ocean.
