## Flavor

- The docks are busy with ships of all sizes coming and going, the air thick with the scent of salt and fish. The sound of clanging metal as cargo is offloaded mixes with the distant calls of seagulls.
- The water beneath the docks is a deep blue, and the occasional fish can be seen swimming past the pylons.

## Rumors

- Captain Thorne is said to be looking for a crew to track down a ship that vanished under mysterious circumstances, leaving no trace behind.
- Some say that the salty old fishermen at the docks know the secret to summoning a sea monster that can grant wishes, but they’re too scared to speak of it.
- There’s a rumor that a treasure chest was recently dropped into the sea from the docks, though no one has been able to recover it yet.
