    - Tink is the energetic and bold owner of **Tink's Curiosities**, a shop filled with fascinating, storm-resistant gadgets and inventions. Known for his wild hair, lightning rod-covered shop, and lightning-fast mind, he has a particular flair for storm-resistant and electrically enchanted items. His enthusiasm for his inventions is contagious, often leading to grand gestures and thrilling tales about his creations and adventures.
    - **Appearance:** Tink is a small gnome with wild, unkempt brown hair, goggles perpetually perched on his head, and a large leather apron covered in pockets filled with odd tools and gadgets. His eyes sparkle with excitement, and his shop is constantly buzzing with arcane energy.
    - **Personality:** Tink is bold, energetic, and sometimes prone to getting carried away with his ideas. He is quick to make deals and loves showing off his newest inventions, often offering impromptu demonstrations. He is a bit absent-minded at times but always comes through when needed.

    - Wizzle is Tink's assistant, responsible for helping customers find what they need and managing the store's stock. She is efficient, smart, and much more grounded than Tink. Wizzle is often the one to smooth over any accidents caused by Tink’s erratic experiments.
    - **Appearance:** Wizzle is slightly taller than Tink, with a neat, bun-like hairstyle, and wears a more practical outfit with an apron. She has a stern yet kind demeanor and always keeps a notebook to jot down her thoughts.
    - **Personality:** Wizzle is calm, logical, and an excellent problem-solver. She is the one who keeps the shop organized and makes sure that things don’t get too chaotic, though she secretly enjoys the thrill of Tink's latest invention going awry.

## Flavor

- The shop is humid and often filled with the sound of whirring gears and crackling arcane energy. Tink has enchanted rain barrels set outside the store to collect the frequent storms, which he uses for his experiments. The atmosphere is both chaotic and thrilling.
- The shop itself has a quaint charm—everything seems to be half-finished or in a state of perpetual experimentation. Small gadgets constantly buzz and whir, filling the air with the scent of ozone.

## Rumors

- Tink’s latest invention, the **Thunderclap Gauntlets**, was originally designed to harness the power of a fallen star, but a malfunction nearly leveled the shop during testing.
- Some say that Tink once had a run-in with a powerful storm elemental, and he now carries a secret artifact that lets him control lightning at will—though no one’s ever seen it.
