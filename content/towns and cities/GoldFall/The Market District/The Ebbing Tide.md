## Flavor

- The shop is dimly lit, with blue and green hues from magical lights illuminating shelves filled with glowing water relics and arcane artifacts. The air smells of fresh sea breeze.
- Gentle ripples in the water can be seen in certain enchanted items, as though the ocean itself is alive within them.

## Rumors

- Isla Seabreeze is searching for an ancient relic called the “Heart of the Ocean,” which could give its wielder control over all bodies of water.
- Drake Windwater once sailed into a storm that he claims to have summoned himself—but no one has seen him leave the shop to confirm the story.
- Sorrel Deepwave is said to have a mysterious, unspoken connection with a sea creature that is older than even the oldest gods of the ocean.
