![[Ship.png]]
**Type**: Brigantine  
**Length**: 110 feet  
**Armament**: 12 cannons (6 on each side), plus a reinforced ballista on the forecastle  
**Appearance**: The ship is sleek and swift, painted in muted blues and grays to blend with the sea. The sails bear an intricate design depicting waves and a sea angel, a symbol of the Sea Angel’s blessing. The wood is weathered but strong, and the deck is meticulously maintained. The ship’s prow is carved with a stylized sea angel figurehead, eyes made of polished blue stone that seem to glow faintly at night.

**Special Features**:

- **Sea Angel’s Blessing**: The figurehead has been blessed by the Sea Angel. Once per day, the ship can call upon the blessing to sail with supernatural speed, increasing its movement for an hour. This is often used to evade danger or close in on an enemy ship.
- **The Depth’s Embrace**: Below decks, there’s a small shrine to the Sea Angel where sacred offerings are made before significant voyages. The crew believes this shrine keeps them safe from sea monsters and hostile weather.
- **Concealed Compartments**: Hidden throughout the ship are various compartments for stashing valuables, smuggling goods, or hiding a few extra crew members. Only Santiago and a few trusted officers know all the locations.
