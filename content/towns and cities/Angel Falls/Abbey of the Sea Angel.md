**Overview**  
The Abbey of the Sea Angel is the center of worship in Angel's Fall, a relatively large structure for a town of its size. The abbey has a mix of recruits, ages 13 to mid-20s, many of whom are rescues from calamities. The majority are vengeance paladins, though a few devotion paladins are also present.

**Leadership**  
The abbey is managed by the stern, serious paladin captain, Captain [[Santiago Herrera]], who trained Arlo from a young age. Known for his disciplined approach, he cares deeply for his recruits and even sneaked extra desserts to Arlo on difficult days. The abbot handles the abbey's operations alongside a small group of clerics and experienced paladins.
