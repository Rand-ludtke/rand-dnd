**Overview**  
Washingstone is a rugged, stormy coastal town perched on a cliffside. It is known for its lighthouse and its salt mines. Unlike Brightshore, Washingstone has a harsher atmosphere but is a critical trade point due to its lighthouse guiding ships through treacherous waters.

**Key NPCs**

- **Lillian Harrow**: The lighthouse keeper, a no-nonsense human woman who has maintained the beacon for 30 years. Her gruff demeanor hides a deep care for the town.
- **Erik Greybeard**: A dwarf who oversees the salt mines. Gruff but fair, he is deeply respected by the miners and townsfolk.
- **Darya Vexwind**: A mysterious tiefling who runs "The Wind’s Whisper," a small inn. Rumored to be a smuggler, though nothing has ever been proven.
