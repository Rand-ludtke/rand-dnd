In naval combat, the environment plays a significant role, often adding an additional layer of complexity to each encounter. From intense storms to dangerous sea creatures, these environmental challenges can alter tactics, affect ship movement, and pose additional threats to the crew. Below are some common environmental challenges, their effects, and how they can influence naval combat.

### **Weather Conditions**

Weather plays a key role in any naval encounter, affecting wind, visibility, and ship maneuverability. Below are examples of weather conditions and their impacts on combat.

#### **Storms**

- **Description:** A violent storm can drastically change the battlefield. High winds, rain, and choppy seas make navigating difficult, and visibility is reduced.
- **Effects:**
    - **Ship Movement:** Reduce movement speed by half (rounded down). Ships must succeed on a **Sailing Check** (DC 15) to avoid becoming **In Irons** (unable to move).
    - **Attacks:** Attack rolls made against ships suffer a **-2 penalty** due to poor visibility and unstable seas.
    - **Environmental Hazards:** Ships are at risk of **lightning strikes** or being struck by **massive waves**. Each round, roll a d6:
        - **1-3:** No effect.
        - **4-5:** One ship within range (roll randomly) takes **1d10 lightning damage**.
        - **6:** A ship in range must make a **Dexterity Saving Throw (DC 15)** or take **2d10 damage** from a massive wave crashing onto the deck.
    - **Duration:** Storms last 1d4+1 rounds, or until the ship escapes.

#### **Fog**

- **Description:** Thick fog reduces visibility, making it difficult to spot enemies and navigate the waters.
- **Effects:**
    - **Movement:** Ships can only move half their speed in fog unless they have a **Lookout** or **Magic** that improves visibility.
    - **Attacks:** Ranged attacks against ships or other creatures suffer a **-2 penalty** to attack rolls due to reduced line of sight.
    - **Perception:** Ships without a **Lookout** have disadvantage on **Perception Checks** to spot enemies or hazards.
    - **Escape:** Characters on the ship can attempt a **Perception Check (DC 12)** to get a better sense of their surroundings and navigate through the fog with more ease.

#### **Clear Weather**

- **Description:** Ideal weather conditions for sailing, with steady winds and clear skies.
- **Effects:**
    - **Movement:** No change to ship movement; ships operate at full speed.
    - **Attacks:** No penalty to attack rolls, and cannons hit with normal accuracy.
    - **Visibility:** Clear skies provide full visibility; no disadvantage on Perception or attack rolls due to environmental conditions.

### **Sea Terrain**

The nature of the sea surrounding the combat zone can also create hazards and challenges. Underwater obstacles, shallow waters, and drifting debris can all impact ship maneuverability and survival.

#### **Rocky Waters**

- **Description:** A region filled with hidden rocks and reefs just below the water’s surface, challenging ship navigation.
- **Effects:**
    - **Movement:** Ships must make a **DC 14 Navigation Check** or risk running aground, reducing their speed by half for the next round.
    - **Damage:** Ships that collide with rocks take **1d6 damage** for every 10 feet they move into the hazard.
    - **Avoiding Hazards:** If a ship can’t navigate the area carefully, they risk taking **additional damage** each round they’re stuck.

#### **Shallow Waters**

- **Description:** Waters where ships risk running aground if they aren’t careful. Shallow areas reduce the maneuverability of larger ships, while smaller ships can navigate more freely.
- **Effects:**
    - **Ship Size Impact:** Small ships move freely, while medium and larger ships move at **half speed** in shallow waters unless they succeed on a **DC 16 Navigation Check** to avoid bottoming out.
    - **Grounded Ships:** Ships that become grounded must make a **Strength (Athletics)** check to free themselves, or they remain stuck until the conditions change.
    - **Combat:** Ships that are grounded are at risk of being boarded, and they suffer disadvantage on attacks made against other ships.

#### **Open Ocean**

- **Description:** The vast, calm expanse of the sea, with no immediate obstacles but unpredictable currents and tides.
- **Effects:**
    - **Movement:** Ship movement is based entirely on wind direction and speed. Ships without sufficient wind may find themselves at a standstill, even with the best efforts.
    - **Current Impact:** The current can speed up or slow down ships. If the GM deems the current significant (based on the story or situation), the ship’s speed may increase or decrease by **10 feet per round**.
    - **Sea Creatures:** The open ocean is home to massive sea creatures, and ships may encounter them. At the GM’s discretion, a roll of **1-3 on a d6** can indicate the appearance of a **large sea creature** (such as a whale, kraken, or giant squid) within **100 feet** of the ship. A creature's appearance might force the ship to make a **Dexterity Saving Throw (DC 14)** to avoid being swiped or rammed.

### **Natural Hazards**

Certain environmental challenges present unique dangers that can create strategic opportunities and perilous risks.

#### **Ice Floes**

- **Description:** Floating ice chunks that pose significant risks, especially in cold climates.
- **Effects:**
    - **Movement:** Ships must make a **DC 15 Navigation Check** to avoid colliding with the ice. Failing the check means the ship must **slow to half speed** for the next round and suffers **1d10 damage** from the impact.
    - **Hull Damage:** Ice may crack the hull, and each round spent in the ice causes **1d4 damage** to the ship.
    - **Escape:** Ships must make another **Navigation Check** (DC 14) every round to navigate the ice floes or risk becoming stuck.

#### **Whirlpools**

- **Description:** Powerful whirlpools can drag ships into deep water, threatening destruction or disorientation.
- **Effects:**
    - **Movement:** Ships near whirlpools (within **30 feet**) must make a **Strength Saving Throw (DC 18)** to avoid being pulled into the vortex. On a failure, the ship is drawn towards the center and is forced to make **1d10 damage** every round it remains trapped.
    - **Escape:** Ships can attempt to **break free** using a **Pilot's Strength (Athletics)** check, requiring **2 Action Points** for a successful escape. It takes **2 rounds** to break free from a whirlpool.

#### **Sea Serpents**

- **Description:** Giant sea serpents and other massive creatures roam the waters, either as passive wanderers or aggressive predators.
- **Effects:**
    - **Creature Interaction:** Ships may encounter a sea serpent. This encounter triggers an **attack roll** against the ship (based on the creature’s stats). The serpent deals **2d10 damage** per successful attack, and ships must avoid its **whip-like tail** or **biting attack**.
    - **Escape:** Ships must make a **Strength Saving Throw (DC 18)** to avoid being tossed by the serpent’s tail. Success means avoiding the attack; failure means the ship is knocked back, potentially into **rocks** or **debris**.

### **Navigating Environmental Challenges**

Environmental challenges can be mitigated through preparation, skill checks, and the strategic use of crew members and magical abilities. A **Lookout** can help spot threats in advance, while a **Pilot** can attempt difficult maneuvers to avoid hazards. Additionally, having certain **spells** or **equipment** (e.g., magical sails, weather-altering artifacts) may provide the crew with the tools they need to deal with extreme weather or other environmental challenges.
