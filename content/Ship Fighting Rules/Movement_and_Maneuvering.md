# Movement and Maneuvering

Ship movement is essential to naval tactics. Adjust sail positions strategically to outmaneuver foes!

## Basic Rules
- Ships **must move** their full speed unless sails are adjusted.
- Movement follows these patterns:
  - Forward: All ships move in a straight line unless maneuvered.
  - Turning: Ships can turn up to twice (60Â° per turn) unless restricted by conditions.

## Rigging and Sail Adjustments
Changing sails impacts speed and direction. Use the table below to determine required riggers for adjustments by ship size.

| Ship Size     | Required Riggers | Adjustment Cost | Notes                           |
|---------------|------------------|-----------------|---------------------------------|
| Small         | 2                | 1 Action Point  | Quick, light adjustments.       |
| Medium        | 4                | 1 Action Point  | Moderate effort.                |
| Large         | 6                | 1 Action Point  | Slower but efficient with crew. |
| Huge          | 8                | 1 Action Point  | Requires coordinated effort.    |
| Gargantuan    | 12               | 2 Action Points | Enormous sails demand manpower. |

If the required number of riggers is met, sail adjustments are free once per turn. Otherwise, 1 Action Point must be spent.

### Movement Example
A medium-sized brigantine (Speed: 5 hexes) starts its turn. With full sails adjusted, it moves forward 3 hexes, turns once, and moves the remaining 2 hexes.
