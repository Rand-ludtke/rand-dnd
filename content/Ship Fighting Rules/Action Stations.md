In ship combat, **Action Stations** represent the primary roles that crew members perform to keep the ship running smoothly during battle. Each role has specific responsibilities, and the crew members at these stations perform actions to maintain the ship’s combat effectiveness. Non-assigned individuals (those not working at an Action Station) still have valuable roles they can perform during combat, either assisting with tasks or performing actions that benefit the ship in other ways.

### **Action Stations**

Each ship has a number of **Action Stations** depending on its size and crew, and during each round, the **Captain** assigns the crew to these roles using **Action Points**. Here’s a breakdown of the primary Action Stations and their duties.

---

### **Primary Action Stations**

- **Captain (Command Station)**
    
    - **Role:** The Captain leads the ship and decides on its strategic actions.
    - **Actions:**
        - Spend **Action Points** to assign orders to the crew.
        - **Push the Crew**: Can attempt to motivate the crew, gaining an extra Action Point for the current round.
        - **Ship Movement**: Can order the ship to move or rotate.
        - **Tactical Decisions**: Can assist with determining attack or defense strategies.
- **Pilot (Movement Station)**
    
    - **Role:** The Pilot controls the movement of the ship, including speed and rotation.
    - **Actions:**
        - Move the ship up to its full speed (based on the wind and ship size).
        - Rotate the ship (usually up to 2 rotations, depending on ship size).
        - **Come About**: Perform a sharp rotation (costs 1-2 Action Points depending on the ship).
        - Can attempt evasive maneuvers, such as **dodging** or changing the course during the enemy's turn (if the ship’s speed and position allow).
- **Gunner (Weapon Station)**
    
    - **Role:** The Gunner operates the ship’s weapons, including cannons, ballistae, and other mounted arms.
    - **Actions:**
        - **Broadside Attack**: Use the ship’s main cannons to fire at a target in the **Broadside Arc**.
        - **Fore/Aft Attack**: Use any forward or aft cannons or weapons for a secondary attack. These attacks are less powerful but can target different angles.
        - **Change Ammo**: Change the type of ammunition (e.g., grape shot, chain shot, round shot) depending on the target.
        - **Attack Roll**: Roll to hit with the ship's weapons and determine the damage based on ammunition type.
- **Carpenter (Repair Station)**
    
    - **Role:** The Carpenter oversees any damage control and repairs to the ship during combat.
    - **Actions:**
        - **Repair All**: Use the Carpenter’s tools to make quick repairs (Restores Hit Die + Carpenter’s Skill Bonus in HP).
        - **Stop Leaks**: Can perform an emergency repair to stop leaks and reduce the ship's damage over time.
        - **Stabilize Damage**: Help prevent further structural issues from worsening (e.g., securing the mast or hull).
- **Rigger (Crew Action Station)**
    
    - **Role:** The Rigger manages the sails, rigging, and overall movement speed of the ship.
    - **Actions:**
        - **Full Sail**: Adjust the sails to achieve maximum speed (costs 2 Action Points).
        - **Maneuvering Adjustments**: Fine-tune the sails for evasive actions or to adjust speed.
        - **Prepare Sail**: Ready the sails to change direction or prepare for a new course.
- **Bosun (Morale and Crew Management Station)**
    
    - **Role:** The Bosun oversees the well-being of the crew, ensuring they remain effective and motivated.
    - **Actions:**
        - **Raise Morale**: Boost the crew’s morale, granting a bonus to their next action or ability to resist penalties.
        - **Inspire**: Rally the crew to take advantage of their surroundings, granting them temporary bonuses to their checks.
        - **Discipline**: Correct any unruly crew members or ensure orders are followed.
- **Lookout**
	- **Limit:** 1 per ship
	- **Pre-Round Action:** Before initiative is rolled each round, any character may choose to become the **Lookout** by spending their action.
	- **Role:** The Lookout is responsible for spotting enemies, hazards, and other key events in the environment. They have enhanced situational awareness, providing the crew with an advantage in the coming round.

#### **Abilities:**

- **Initiative Bonus:** The Lookout rolls initiative for the ship and may add or subtract their **Sailing Die** from the result.
- **+1 AC:** Ships with a Lookout receive a **+1 bonus to AC** for the round due to the added vigilance.
- **Spot Hazards:** The Lookout can call out enemy movements or incoming attacks, giving the crew a chance to prepare. This grants the ship’s **Pilot** or **Captain** a +1 bonus on any Evasion checks to dodge incoming threats.
---

### **Dynamic Role Changes per Round**

In addition to the **Lookout**, ships can also change **other crew roles** as the battle progresses. These role changes allow the crew to adapt to changing conditions, like enemy movement, damage to the ship, or the need for different types of attacks.

#### **Role Change System Based on Ship Size:**

- **Small Ships (1-2 Action Stations)**
    
    - **Role Changes per Round:** 1
        - The Captain can switch between roles like **Gunner**, **Pilot**, or **Rigger** for flexibility. Typically, a small ship will only need one crew member to take on multiple tasks each round.
        - Example: The **Lookout** can switch to **Gunner** if enemy ships are within range for a broadside.
- **Medium Ships (3-4 Action Stations)**
    
    - **Role Changes per Round:** 2
        - In a medium-sized ship, the crew can switch between roles more freely, allowing for greater tactical flexibility.
        - Example: The **Pilot** can swap to the **Gunner** role after a maneuver is completed or the **Carpenter** can take over repairs during an urgent moment.
        - **Extra Roles to Switch:**
            - **Gunner ↔ Carpenter** (when repairs are needed after taking damage)
            - **Rigger ↔ Bosun** (to adjust sails or rally the crew’s morale)
- **Large Ships (5+ Action Stations)**
    
    - **Role Changes per Round:** 3
        - Larger ships, with their larger crew and more action stations, can allow for multiple role changes, giving the crew more adaptability.
        - Example: The **Bosun** might swap to **Carpenter** for emergency repairs, while the **Lookout** moves into the **Pilot** station for evasive maneuvers.
        - **Extra Roles to Switch:**
            - **Lookout ↔ Pilot** (if the Lookout needs to assist with maneuvering or the Pilot needs help spotting threats)
            - **Gunner ↔ Bosun** (to boost morale and then quickly return to fire)
            - **Carpenter ↔ Rigger** (for quick repairs or preparing sails during critical moments)

#### **How Role Changes Work:**

- **Action Point Costs:** Changing a role costs **1 Action Point** per switch. For example, if the Captain decides to switch from a **Gunner** to **Lookout**, it costs the ship **1 Action Point** to do so. Larger ships may have more flexibility due to their increased crew capacity.
- **Timing:** Role changes take place during the **Captain’s Phase** of the combat round, and crew members may perform their new duties once the change has been made.

### **Example Scenario:**

- **Ship Type:** Medium Ship (3 Action Stations)
    
- **Crew Roles:**
    
    - **Lookout** (Pre-Round Action, +1 AC)
    - **Pilot** (Moves ship and performs evasive actions)
    - **Gunner** (Fires cannons at the enemy ship)
    - **Bosun** (Raises morale)
    
    During the round, the following role changes occur:
    
    - **Captain** switches the **Pilot** to the **Lookout** position for the next round to gain a +1 initiative bonus.
    - The **Lookout** becomes the **Carpenter** for an emergency repair after the ship takes damage from an enemy broadside.
    
    **End Result:** The ship gains +1 AC from the Lookout, gets +1 to initiative, and performs a critical repair to the hull using the Carpenter’s skills.

### **Non-Assigned Crew Members' Actions**

If a crew member is **not assigned to an Action Station** or has completed their assigned task, they still have several valuable options for helping the ship and the crew.

#### **General Actions for Non-Assigned Crew:**

- **Assist in Repairs**
    
    - Non-assigned crew can still assist in making repairs to the ship’s hull, sails, or weapons.
    - If a crew member has the **Carpenter’s Tools** proficiency, they can help make repairs during their turn (restoring **half the repair amount** of what a skilled carpenter would restore).
- **Ready Action**
    
    - Non-assigned crew members can **Ready an Action** to perform a task when certain conditions are met. For example, they might Ready an action to assist in **changing the course** once the Pilot has moved the ship, or to aid in **firing a weapon** once it is within range.
- **Use a Spell or Ability**
    
    - If the ship has any **spellcasters** on board, non-assigned crew can still cast spells (such as **Control Water** or **Mage Armor**) to benefit the ship and its crew.
    - Example: A **Cleric** on board could cast **Bless** on the crew or **Shield of Faith** on the Captain.
- **Reinforce Defenses**
    
    - Non-assigned crew members can use their turns to secure weak points or assist with strategic positioning to reduce incoming damage.
    - Example: A crew member with **Smith's Tools** might reinforce the ship's armor or fasten loose cargo to prevent it from becoming a hazard.
- **Melee Combat**
    
    - Crew members not assigned to stations can engage in melee combat or board enemy ships if they are close enough.
    - Example: A crew member with a **sword** might engage in **close combat** during a boarding action or defend against boarders.
- **Distribute Ammo or Supplies**
    
    - Crew members can help with organizing ammunition, supplies, or repairing smaller equipment (such as cannons or ballistae).
    - This doesn’t affect the ship directly but may allow the **Gunner** or **Carpenter** to perform their jobs more efficiently.
- **Ranged Combat**
    
    - Crew members not assigned to stations can engage in ranged combat or board enemy ships if they are close enough.
    - Ranged shots will be made with disadvantage if not proficient in being on a boat(at least 6 months at sea) if double disadvantage is applied it is an auto miss

### **Action Station Example:**

During a ship’s turn, the **Captain** assigns the following roles:

- **Pilot:** Moves the ship.
- **Gunner:** Fires the Broadside at an enemy ship.
- **Carpenter:** Makes repairs to the hull after taking cannon fire.
- **Bosun:** Raises morale to give the crew a bonus.

The non-assigned crew then has the following options:

- **Lookout:** A crew member spots an incoming volley of cannonballs and warns the ship.
- **Assist with Repairs:** Two unassigned crew members help the Carpenter repair the hull, each contributing **+1** to the repair roll.
- **Spellcasting:** A **Cleric** casts **Shield of Faith** on the Captain, providing a defensive bonus.

This system allows for maximum flexibility, ensuring all crew members contribute to the success of the ship while maintaining the dynamic, fast-paced nature of naval combat.
