Movement depends on sail configuration, wind conditions, and ship size. Larger ships benefit from higher base speeds but face challenges in turning and responding to rapid adjustments.

---

### **Base Movement**

Ships move in **50 ft hexes per turn**, adjusted by their sail positioning, crew efficiency, and wind conditions. Larger ships are faster in straight lines but harder to maneuver. A ship must move directly forward to the space in front of its bow. A ship may rotate twice (rotate one hex face or **60º**) at any point before, during, or after its movement, but no ship may turn more than once per space. Ships that are In Irons may not move forward but may still rotate once. Ships that are Anchored cannot move or turn

**Example Base Speeds by Size:**

- **Small (e.g., Rowboat):** 2–3 hexes per turn.
- **Medium (e.g., Sloop):** 4–6 hexes per turn.
- **Large (e.g., Brigantine):** 6–8 hexes per turn.
- **Huge (e.g., Man of War):** 5–7 hexes per turn.
- **Gargantuan (e.g., Ship of the Line):** 7–9 hexes per turn.

### **Mandatory Movement**

Ships must move the full distance allowed by their current sail configuration unless their sails are adjusted.

- **Sail Adjustment Table:**  
    Changing sail positions requires a certain number of **Riggers** based on ship size. If the required number is met, the adjustment is free (no action). If not, 1 action point must be spent.
    
| **Ship Size**  | **Required Riggers** | **Adjustment Cost** | **Notes**                       |
| -------------- | -------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| **Small**      | 2 Riggers            | 1 Action Point      | Quick, light adjustments.       |
| **Medium**     | 4 Riggers            | 1 Action Point      | Moderate effort.                |
| **Large**      | 6 Riggers            | 1 Action Point      | Slower but efficient with crew. |
| **Huge**       | 8 Riggers            | 1 Action Point      | Requires coordinated effort.    |
| **Gargantuan** | 12 Riggers           | 2 Action Points     | Enormous sails demand manpower. |
- If the required number of Riggers is met, sail adjustments are **free**(once per turn) and do not cost an action point.
	- **Sail Positions:**
	    - **Full Sails:** Maximum speed, but the ship suffers disadvantage on Dexterity saves and turning maneuvers.
	    - **Half Sails:** Balanced speed and control.
	    - **No Sails (Drifting):** Ship remains drifts in direction of wind 1 Hex and may pivot once per turn.


### **Wind and Movement**

Wind direction significantly influences sailing speed and maneuverability. Use the following optional rules to add strategic depth to naval encounters.

#### **Wind Direction**

Roll a d6 at the start of the encounter to determine wind direction:

|**d6 Roll**|**Flat Top Hex Direction**|**Pointy Top Hex Direction**|
|---|---|---|
|1|North|Northeast|
|2|Northeast|East|
|3|Southeast|Southeast|
|4|South|Southwest|
|5|Southwest|West|
|6|Northwest|Northwest|

#### **Points of Sail**

The ship’s **Point of Sail** determines its speed based on the wind’s angle relative to the ship's heading.

|**Point of Sail**|**Ship Speed**|
|---|---|
|**With the Wind**|Full Speed.|
|**Close to the Wind**|Half Speed (rounded down, minimum 1 hex).|
|**In Irons**|Speed 0 (may still turn once).|

**Example:** If the wind is coming from the North (1), a ship heading North is "In Irons" and cannot move but can pivot once. If heading Northeast, the ship is "Close to the Wind" and moves at half speed. If heading Southeast, South, or Southwest, it moves "With the Wind" at full speed.

### **Larger Ship Maneuverability**

- Large ships (e.g., Brigantine) and above require additional effort to turn:
    - Turning reduces speed by 1 hex per 60-degree pivot.
    - Pivoting a full 180 degrees requires two consecutive turns or special conditions (e.g., magic, advanced equipment).
