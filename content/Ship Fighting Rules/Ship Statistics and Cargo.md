## **Ship Stats**

Each ship has the following core attributes:

- **Strength (STR):** Reflects the ship's offensive capabilities, based on the size and quality of its weaponry and crew coordination.
- **Dexterity (DEX):** Represents maneuverability; smaller, more agile ships excel in this area.
- **Constitution (CON):** Determines the ship's durability, structural integrity, and overall hit points.
- **Skill (CHR):** Measures the quality of the crew, impacting actions such as aiming, repairs, and specialized maneuvers.
- **Armor Class (AC):** Represents the ship's ability to resist damage, either through its hull's resilience or its agility.
- **Speed:** The number of 50 ft hexes a ship can travel per turn, influenced by its sails, wind direction, and crew performance.

### **Hit Points**

A ship’s hit points (HP) represent its structural health, adjusted for size and role in combat. Instead of a fixed value, HP is presented as a range to allow for variability, influenced by modifications, damage types, and environmental effects.

**Hit Point Ranges by Size:**

- **Small Ships (e.g., Rowboat):** 30–50 HP
- **Medium Ships (e.g., Sloop):** 100–150 HP
- **Large Ships (e.g., Brigantine):** 200–300 HP
- **Huge Ships (e.g., Man of War):** 400–600 HP
- **Gargantuan Ships (e.g., Ship of the Line):** 700–1000+ HP

**Modifiers for Hit Points:**

- **Reinforced Hull:** +20 x^2 HP (x=size of ship aka small ship is 1 and gargantuan is 5)
- **Weak Hull (Aging/Damaged):** -15 x^2 HP
- **Magical Reinforcements:** +50 x^2 HP

## **Cargo Mechanics**

Cargo mechanics have been expanded to reflect the practical use of ship storage and the consequences of overloading.

### **Cargo Slots**

- **Definition:** 1 cargo slot represents approximately **125 cubic feet** (5x5x5 ft) of space or **500 lbs** of weight.
- **Standard Capacities by Size:**
    - **Small (Sloop):** 3–5 slots.
    - **Medium (Brigantine):** 6–10 slots.
    - **Large (Man of War):** 15–20 slots.

### **Overloading Cargo**

Exceeding the cargo capacity introduces penalties that affect the ship's performance and crew:

- **Speed Penalty:** For every 2 additional slots of cargo, the ship's speed is reduced by **-1 hex per turn**.
- **Crew Fatigue:** After 6 hours of travel, the crew must make a **DC 12 Constitution saving throw** or suffer **1 level of exhaustion** due to overwork.

**Example:**  
A sloop carrying 7 slots (2 over capacity) moves 1 hex slower per turn and risks crew fatigue.
