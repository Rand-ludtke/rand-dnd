In naval combat, repairing your ship quickly can be the difference between victory and sinking. A ship's condition impacts its functionality, movement, and ability to fire weapons. Repairs can be performed either as a ship action or by individual crew members during combat.

### **Repairing Ships**

Repairs are essential to keep your ship in fighting shape. While ships can repair themselves using the **Repair All** action, individual crew members can also make repairs on their turns. Here’s a breakdown of how repairs work, including scaling based on ship size and crew involvement.

### **Repairs In Combat**

#### **Standard Repairs**

- **Non-Derelict Ships:**  
    Repairing a non-derelict ship requires **2 Action Points** and restores **Hit Die + Carpenter’s Skill Bonus** in HP.
    
    - The **Hit Die** is determined by the ship's size:
        - Small Ship: **1d6**
        - Medium Ship: **1d8**
        - Large Ship: **1d10**
        - Huge Ship: **1d12**
        - Gargantuan Ship: **2d12**
    - **Carpenter's Skill Bonus:** A skilled carpenter adds their **Proficiency Bonus** (or an equivalent skill bonus like **Dexterity (Smith's Tools)**).
    - Example: A **Large Ship** has a **1d10** Hit Die. If a skilled carpenter (with a +3 bonus) works on repairs, the ship would restore **1d10 + 3** HP.
- **Derelict Ships:**  
    If a ship is **Derelict** (0 HP), repairing it requires **all Action Points** and restores only **half the normal HP** per roll.
    
    - The ship is essentially in a critical state, so repairs take longer and are less effective.
    - Example: A **Medium Ship** has **1d8** Hit Die. If it’s derelict and a carpenter works to repair it, the repair would restore **half the rolled amount** (rounded down). So, a roll of **5** on the **1d8** would restore **2 HP**.

### **Crew Assists**

#### **Individual Assistance**

- **Unskilled Carpenters**:  
    Unskilled crew members can assist with repairs, but their help isn’t as effective. Each additional unskilled carpenter provides a **+1 bonus** to the repair roll.
    
    - Example: A **Large Ship** with 1 skilled carpenter (+3) and 2 unskilled carpenters (+2 total) will have a total repair bonus of **+5**.
- **Skilled Carpenters**:  
    Skilled carpenters (i.e., those proficient with **Smith's Tools** or other appropriate tools) add **+2 bonus** per helper.
    
    - Example: A **Gargantuan Ship** with 1 skilled carpenter (+3) and 3 skilled carpenters (+6 total) would have a **+9 bonus** to repairs.
- **Maximum Bonus**:  
    The bonus for repairs caps at **+10** total (skilled carpenters and helpers combined).

### **Conditions and Their Effects**

When a ship takes significant damage, it may fall into various conditions that affect its combat readiness. These conditions influence how a ship moves, its combat effectiveness, and its repairs.

#### **Common Ship Conditions:**

- **Derelict**
    
    - **Effect:** The ship is at **0 HP** and cannot move. It is highly vulnerable to further damage.
    - **Repair Method:** Requires **all Action Points** to repair, and only restores half the normal HP per roll. Once HP is restored above 0, the ship regains full functionality.
- **Crippled**
    
    - **Effect:** The ship is at **50% HP** or below, and its **speed is halved**. Additionally, it suffers a **-2 penalty** to all attack rolls.
    - **Repair Method:** **Repair All** or individual repairs can restore full functionality. The **Crippled** condition is removed once the ship regains **above 50% HP**.
- **Leaking**
    
    - **Effect:** The ship suffers **1d4 damage** each round due to a hull breach.
    - **Repair Method:** Requires a **Strength (Athletics)** or **Carpenter's Tools** check with a **DC 15** to stop the leak. Success halts the ongoing damage.
- **Mast Down**
    
    - **Effect:** The ship’s **speed is reduced**, and it has difficulty rotating.
    - **Repair Method:** Requires a **Strength** or **Dexterity** check with a **DC 18** to temporarily stabilize the mast. Replacing it requires a **Repair All** action and significant time.
## **Fire Conditions**

Fires can spread quickly on ships and cause significant damage if not controlled.

### **Causes of Fire**

- **Explosive or Incendiary Shot** hitting the hull, sails, or deck.
- **Critical Hits** from fire-related attacks.

### **Effects of Fire**

- **Fire Spread:** Fire spreads **10 feet** per round if not extinguished.
- **Damage Over Time:** A ship on fire takes **1d6 fire damage** per round per active fire.
- **Disabling Effects:** Fire can disable specific stations (e.g., gunners, sails, or rigging) if it spreads to their locations.

### **Extinguishing Fire**

- **Repair Action:** A repair action can be used to extinguish fires instead of repairing damage.
    - **Check:** Requires a **Strength or Dexterity Check (DC 15)** by the crew or a specific character.
    - **Fire Suppression Equipment:** Ships equipped with buckets, pumps, or magical means gain advantage on fire-extinguishing checks.
    - **Magic:** Spells like _Create Water_ or _Control Flames_ can also be used to put out fires.

## **Other Conditions**

### **Flooding**

- **Cause:** Critical hits to the hull or failed checks in hazardous conditions.
- **Effect:** Water fills the ship, reducing its speed by **10 feet per round** and imposing disadvantage on navigation checks.
- **Repair:** Requires **2 repair actions** to patch holes and remove water.

### **Damaged Masts**

- **Cause:** Critical hits or targeted attacks to the mast.
- **Effect:** Speed is reduced by **half** until the mast is repaired.
- **Repair:** Requires a **DC 18 Strength or Carpenter’s Tools Check** to replace or repair the mast.

### **Repair Example**

1. **Non-Derelict Ship Repair**  
    A **Medium Ship** with **80 HP** has taken **40 damage** from cannon fire and has **40 HP remaining**. The captain assigns 2 Action Points for repairs.
    
    - The ship has **1d8** Hit Die for repairs.
    - A **skilled carpenter** (with a +3 bonus) works on the repairs.
    - The carpenter rolls a **6** on the **1d8** repair die.
    - The total repair value is **6 + 3 = 9 HP** restored.
    - The ship now has **49 HP** (40 HP + 9 HP from repairs).
2. **Derelict Ship Repair**  
    A **Large Ship** with **0 HP** is **Derelict**. The captain decides to spend **all Action Points** to repair it.
    
    - The ship has **1d10** Hit Die for repairs.
    - The ship has 1 skilled carpenter (+3 bonus) and 2 unskilled carpenters (+2 total).
    - The total bonus to repairs is **+5**.
    - The carpenter rolls a **7** on the **1d10** repair die.
    - The total repair value is **(7 ÷ 2) + 5 = 6 HP restored**.
    - The ship now has **6 HP**, but it is still **Derelict** and vulnerable until fully repaired.
