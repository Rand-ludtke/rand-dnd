# Ship Statistics and Cargo

Ships are represented as specialized stat blocks to reflect their scale and role in encounters.

## Ship Stats
Each ship has the following attributes:
- **Strength (STR):** Reflects attack potency, based on weapon size and crew skill.
- **Dexterity (DEX):** Represents maneuverability; smaller ships excel here.
- **Constitution (CON):** Determines hit points and structural resilience.
- **Skill (CHR):** Measures crew quality, impacting accuracy and specialized actions.
- **AC:** Hull resilience or agility.
- **Speed:** Movement in 50 ft hexes per turn.

### Hit Points
Hit points are no longer level-based. Instead, ships use a range adjusted for their size and role, with damage scaled up for enhanced realism. Example ranges:
- Small (Rowboat): 30-50 HP
- Medium (Sloop): 100-150 HP
- Large (Brigantine): 200-300 HP
- Huge (Man of War): 400-600 HP
- Gargantuan (Ship of the Line): 700-1000+ HP

HP can vary by ship modifications, damage type, and environmental effects.

## Cargo
Ships now include expanded cargo mechanics:
- **1 Cargo Slot:** Represents approximately 5x5x5 ft (~125 cubic feet) and/or 500 lbs.
- **Overloading:** Exceeding cargo capacity imposes penalties:
  - -1 Speed for every 2 extra slots used.
  - Crew requires a Constitution saving throw (DC 12) after 6 hours of travel due to fatigue.

Example capacities by size:
- Small (Sloop): 3-5 slots.
- Medium (Brigantine): 6-10 slots.
- Large (Man of War): 15-20 slots.
