Naval combat prioritizes the coordination of crew, use of action points, and allocation of weapons.

### **Order of Combat**

Naval combat follows these steps each round:


1. **Initiative Phase**
    
    - Each ship rolls for initiative (1d20 + ship’s Dexterity modifier).
    - If the ship has a **Lookout**, they roll initiative instead of the captain.
    
2. **Ship's Turn**
    
    - On a ship’s turn, the pilot or captain may:
	    - The captain may attempt to **Push the Crew**.
        - Move up to the ship’s speed.
        - Perform **two rotations** for free.
        - Take any prepared actions chosen during the Captain Phase.
        - Unused ship actions are rolled by the captain.
3. **Repeat Rounds**
    
    - Continue until the combat concludes.

### **Initiative**

Initiative is rolled at the start of every round:

- **Roll:** 1d20 + ship’s Dexterity modifier.
- If a **Lookout** is present, they roll initiative instead.

### **Captain's Phase**

The captain sets the tone and strategy each round:

- **Action Points:**  
    Each ship has a number of AP (see previous table), which the captain spends on actions for the crew or ship.
    
- **Push the Crew:**
    
    - The captain may make a **Persuasion** or **Intimidation** check (DC 15).
    - Success grants +1 AP this round but reduces AP by 1 in the next round.
    - Failure results in no bonus and imposes **-1 to crew morale checks** until the captain restores morale.

### **Action Points**

Each ship has a pool of **Action Points** based on its size and crew organization.

|**Ship Size**|**Action Points**|
|---|---|
|**Small:**|2|
|**Medium:**|3|
|**Large:**|4|
|**Huge:**|5|
|**Gargantuan:**|6|

**Ship Actions**

Ship actions cost AP and are carried out by the crew.

|**Action**|**AP Cost**|**Description**|**Required Station**|
|---|---|---|---|
|**Attack (Broadside)**|1|Fire primary weapons at a target in the ship's Broadside arc.|Gunner|
|**Attack (Fore/Aft)**|2|Fire secondary weapons with one die rank lower (e.g., d6 → d4).|Gunner|
|**Repair All**|All|Restore hit points equal to the ship’s attack damage or remove the Derelict condition.|Carpenter|
|**Full Sail**|2|Move one extra hex this turn.|Rigger|
|**Come About**|Varies|Rotate an additional time. (Cost depends on ship size; default is 2 AP.)|Pilot|
|**Ram**|All|Ram if forward arcs of its main hex touch another ship. Deals critical damage.|Gunner|
|**Change Ammo Type**|0|Switch ammunition types (e.g., round shot, chain shot).|Gunner|
|**Drop Anchor**|All|Halts the ship’s speed and sets it to Anchored.|Pilot|
|**Weigh Anchor**|All|Halves speed but removes Anchored condition.|Pilot|

### **Arc of Fire**

- Most ships fire their primary weapons from their **Broadside arcs** (left and right).
- Specialized weapons, like **chase guns**, can fire only in **Fore or Aft arcs** (front or rear).
- Gunners must position ships to align arcs with targets before firing.

### **Weapon Mechanics**

- Each cannon or ballista requires **1–2 crew members** depending on its size and strength:
    - **Light Weapons (d4 damage):** Operable by 1 crew member.
    - **Medium Weapons (d6–d8 damage):** Require 2 crew members for optimal use.
    - **Heavy Weapons (d10–d12 damage):** Require 2 crew members with proficiency for maximum efficiency.

#### **To Hit Rolls:**

- Attack rolls are based on crew skill and weapon proficiency:
    - **+4:** Unskilled crew.
    - **+6:** Partially skilled crew (e.g., bow users).
    - **+8:** Fully trained crew (e.g., artillery specialists).

#### **Damage Rolls:**

- Each cannon fires once per turn if crewed. Roll for the total number of hits based on the number of crewed cannons firing.
    - Example: If 6 cannons fire with a +6 to hit, roll 6 attack rolls, then calculate damage for each successful hit.

### **Cannon Accuracy (Close Range)**

If a ship is within **2 hexes**, roll to determine how many cannons hit. You roll a Dx x being how many cannons on that side you are firing The number you get is how many that hit.

Example: A Ship is firing 6 cannons on the Starboard side they roll a D6 and roll to get a 4 So they hit 4 times and deal 4D6 damage.

### **Special Ammunition**

- **Standard Shot:** Normal damage.
- **Chain Shot:** Reduces enemy ship speed by **1 hex** per successful hit.
- **Grapeshot:** Deals reduced damage but targets exposed crew instead of the hull.
- **Explosive Rounds:** Requires specialized equipment, deals additional fire damage.

Switching ammunition types takes **1 turn** per cannon to prepare.

### **Repairs**

- **In Combat:**
    
    - Non-derelict ships: Repairing requires **2 Action Points** and restores **Hit Die + Carpenter’s Skill Bonus** in HP.
    - Derelict ships: Repairing uses **all Action Points** and restores only half the normal HP per roll.
- **Crew Assists:**
    
    - Each additional unskilled carpenter provides a **+1 bonus** to repairs.
    - Skilled carpenters add a **+2 bonus** per helper.
