Ramming is a high-risk maneuver often used to disable or destroy enemy ships. Properly equipped ships can perform this maneuver with reduced risk, while unprepared ships face significant damage to themselves.

---

### **Ramming Requirements**

- A ship must move at least **half its maximum speed** in a straight line before attempting to ram.
- The attacking ship makes a **Strength Check vs. Enemies Dexterity Check** to determine success.

---

### **Ramming Damage**

- **Base Damage:** Calculated based on the attacking ship's size and speed.

|**Attacking Ship Size**|**Damage (Base)**|
|---|---|
|**Small (e.g., Rowboat):**|2d8|
|**Medium (e.g., Sloop):**|4d8|
|**Large (e.g., Brigantine):**|6d8|
|**Huge (e.g., Man of War):**|8d8|
|**Gargantuan (e.g., Ship of the Line):**|10d8|

#### **Damage Modifiers**

- Add the attacking ship's Strength modifier to the base damage.
- For every additional **50 ft(1 Hex) of movement** beyond the minimum, add **+1d8 damage** (to a max of +3d8).

### **Consequences of Ramming**

1. **Without Proper Ramming Gear:**
    
    - The attacking ship suffers **1/4 of the total damage dealt**.
    - If the target ship **wins the Strength Check**, the attacking ship instead takes **1/2 the damage dealt**, and the ramming ship’s hull integrity may be compromised.
2. **With Ramming Gear:**
    
    - The attacking ship takes **no damage** unless it loses the Strength Check.
    - If it loses, the attacking ship suffers **1/2 the damage dealt**, and the ramming gear may break. Roll a d20—on a roll of **1**, the gear is destroyed.

---

### **Target Ship Damage**

- The rammed ship must succeed on a **Constitution Saving Throw (DC = attacking ship’s Strength + 8)** or be forced into one of the following conditions:
    - **Leaking Hull:** Takes **1d10 damage** per turn until repaired.
    - **Immobilized:** Loses movement entirely until repairs are made.
    - **Capsized:** The ship tips over, losing all functionality and requiring magical or dockside repair to recover.

### **Tactical Notes**

- Larger ships are more likely to succeed in ramming but harder to maneuver into position.
- Smaller, faster ships are more vulnerable to damage but can use speed to escape or position themselves strategically.
