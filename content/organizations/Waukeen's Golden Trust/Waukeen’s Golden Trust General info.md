Waukeen’s Golden Trust is a guild of wealthy merchants and bankers who worship the goddess Waukeen, the goddess of trade. Based in Goldfall, one of Whirong’s richest cities, they oversee the flow of commerce and wealth between the three kingdoms. The guild provides loans to traders, invests in merchant fleets, and ensures the stability of trade routes. Their network spans across the kingdoms, and they are well-known for their luxurious banking halls, which serve as secure vaults for storing valuables. Nobles, wealthy merchants, and governments often turn to the Golden Trust for financial backing.
