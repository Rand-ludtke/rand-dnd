## True Nature

The Moonlight Pirates are actually a covert arm of Sadrekkeor’s influence. Although they appear as a rogue pirate crew, they are in fact a tool for his wider plans, working to destabilize regions and disrupt local defenses as part of his plot to control the continent.

---

## Resources and Technology

- **Advanced Weaponry**: The crew has access to high-tech weapons far beyond what typical pirates possess. These include arcane-powered weapons and mechanical contraptions.
- **Golems**: A few powerful golems serve among the Moonlight Pirates. These constructs act as shock troopers during high-stakes raids, providing muscle and resistance to physical attacks.
- **Highly Trained Operatives**: The pirates operate with precision and efficiency thanks to Sadrekkeor’s training and leadership. They are organized more like a mercenary company than a typical pirate band.
- ### Magic Item: _Veil of the Abyss_
	**Wondrous Item (Ship), Legendary**
	
	The Moonlight Pirates' ship, _The Black Gale_, is equipped with the _Veil of the Abyss_, a powerful magical artifact gifted by Sadrekkeor. This device allows the ship to vanish entirely, leaving no trace for pursuers.
	
	**Description**: The _Veil of the Abyss_ appears as an ornate, enchanted compass mounted on the ship's wheel. When activated, swirling tendrils of dark mist unfurl from the compass, spreading over the ship and creating an eerie, silent shroud.
	
	**Abilities**:
	
	1. **Abyssal Cloak (Invisibility)**
	    
	    - Once per day, the _Veil of the Abyss_ can cast a spell that renders _The Black Gale_ and everything on it completely invisible for up to one hour. This effect functions similarly to the _Invisibility_ spell but affects the entire vessel and all on board. During this time, the ship becomes undetectable to all magical and non-magical forms of detection. The cloak disperses if the ship attacks or collides with another vessel.
	2. **Shadow Step (Teleportation)**
	    
	    - Alternatively, once every seven days, the _Veil of the Abyss_ can be used to teleport _The Black Gale_ and its crew to a predetermined location within 100 miles. This effect requires a one-minute ritual to activate, and the entire ship is enveloped in an impenetrable black fog before vanishing, appearing silently at the destination moments later. The last-known location is left without any sign of departure, effectively erasing all traces of the ship's presence.

## Operations

- **Secrecy and Discipline**: The Moonlight Pirates are remarkably organized, using covert methods and secret sea routes. They rarely, if ever, leave behind survivors or captives, ensuring that very little reliable information leaks about them.
- **Strategic Targets**: They often target villages with low defenses or important individuals, striking only when victory is certain. This tactic keeps them formidable and leaves a lasting fear among coastal towns.

- **Sentinel Golem**(1 cobalt and 5 (2 on ship 3 in base) crimson helmed)
    
    - Towering constructs with enchanted armor, Sentinel Golems serve as frontline defenders and shock troops. They are nearly impervious to non-magical attacks and have the strength to tear through enemy barricades.

    - Golems equipped with powerful arcane cannons, these constructs serve as mobile artillery. The cannons can launch explosive or elemental projectiles, allowing the Moonlight Pirates to devastate defenses from a distance.
- **Spectral Sentry**(5 of them)

## Role in Sadrekkeor’s Scheme

The Moonlight Pirates are a critical part of Sadrekkeor’s campaign to disrupt and conquer. Their raids weaken local governments and drain resources from towns, making it easier for him to expand his influence over the continent. The Moonlight Pirates' apparent independence allows Sadrekkeor to operate in secret, as their activities are seldom linked back to him.

## Secret Hideout: The **Whispering Cove**

Hidden deep within the rock formations of the uncharted **Isle of Shadows**, _The Black Gale_ has a secluded base known as the **Whispering Cove**. This concealed inlet is protected by jagged cliffs, treacherous reefs, and dense fog, making it nearly impossible to find without precise knowledge of the location.

**Description**:

- **Natural Camouflage**: The Cove’s entrance is concealed by overlapping cliffs and dense mangrove growth, and only a narrow passage allows entry for ships, ensuring that only those who know the exact route can safely navigate inside.
- **Echoing Stone Formations**: Named for the strange acoustics within the cove, the caves and rock formations amplify even whispers, creating an eerie echo throughout. The Moonlight Pirates use this feature to stay alert to any approaching intruders.
- **Hidden Supply Depot**: Within the cove, the pirates maintain hidden stockpiles of supplies, ammunition, and repair tools, as well as a smaller dock for rowboats and scout ships.

Only trusted members of Sadrekkeor's network know of the **Whispering Cove**, and it remains a vital base for coordinating raids and disappearing without a trace.
