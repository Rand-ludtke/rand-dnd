**Leader**: Subordinate to Sadrekkeor (Adventurers Guild Leader)  
**Primary Goal**: Execute raids and sow fear in coastal towns under Sadrekkeor’s orders.

## True Nature

The Moonlight Pirates are actually a covert arm of Sadrekkeor’s influence. Although they appear as a rogue pirate crew, they are in fact a tool for his wider plans, working to destabilize regions and disrupt local defenses as part of his plot to control the continent.

## Resources and Technology

- **Advanced Weaponry**: The crew has access to high-tech weapons far beyond what typical pirates possess. These include arcane-powered weapons and mechanical contraptions.
- **Golems**: A few powerful golems serve among the Moonlight Pirates. These constructs act as shock troopers during high-stakes raids, providing muscle and resistance to physical attacks.
- **Highly Trained Operatives**: The pirates operate with precision and efficiency thanks to Sadrekkeor’s training and leadership. They are organized more like a mercenary company than a typical pirate band.

## Operations

- **Secrecy and Discipline**: The Moonlight Pirates are remarkably organized, using covert methods and secret sea routes. They rarely, if ever, leave behind survivors or captives, ensuring that very little reliable information leaks about them.
- **Strategic Targets**: They often target villages with low defenses or important individuals, striking only when victory is certain. This tactic keeps them formidable and leaves a lasting fear among coastal towns.

## Role in Sadrekkeor’s Scheme

The Moonlight Pirates are a critical part of Sadrekkeor’s campaign to disrupt and conquer. Their raids weaken local governments and drain resources from towns, making it easier for him to expand his influence over the continent. The Moonlight Pirates' apparent independence allows Sadrekkeor to operate in secret, as their activities are seldom linked back to him.
