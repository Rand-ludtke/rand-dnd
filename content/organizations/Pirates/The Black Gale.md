#### **Actions**

The Black Pearl can take 3 actions on its turn, choosing from the options below. It can take only 2 actions if it has fewer than 20 crew, and only 1 action if it has fewer than 10.

- **Fire Cannons** _(Recharge 5–6)_. The Black Pearl fires its broadsides. Choose one side of the ship to fire. All creatures and objects in a 120-foot-long, 10-foot-wide line originating from that side must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 44 (8d10) bludgeoning damage on a failed save or half as much on a successful one.
	- **Cannon Ball.** Ranged Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, range 600/2,400 ft., one target. _Hit_: 44 (8d10) bludgeoning damage.
	
- **Ram**. The Black Pearl moves up to its speed in a straight line. If it collides with another vessel or a stationary object, it deals 44 (8d10) bludgeoning damage to the target and 22 (4d10) bludgeoning damage to itself.
	
- **Boarding Action**. The crew of the Black Pearl makes up to 10 melee or ranged weapon attacks, using their own stats.
	
- **Arcane Cannon Golem**. (3 have seperate actions)
	_Range:_ 150/600 ft.  
	_Attack Bonus:_ +7 to hit  
	_Hit:_ 22 (4d10) force damage and 15 (3d6) fire damage (choose on hit). On a critical hit, the target must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or be knocked prone.

#### **Legendary Actions**

The Black Pearl can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action can be used at a time, and only at the end of another creature's turn.

- **Evasive Maneuver (Costs 1 Action)**. The Black Pearl moves up to half its speed without provoking opportunity attacks.
- **Dark Fog (Costs 2 Actions)**. The ship releases a dense, supernatural fog in a 120-foot radius. The area becomes heavily obscured for 1 minute or until the fog is dispersed by a strong wind.
- **Haunted Echoes (Costs 3 Actions)**. The sound of wailing spirits emanates from the Black Pearl. Each enemy within 180 feet of the ship must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

#### **Features**

- **Unholy Aura**. The Black Pearl is imbued with a dark curse. Undead creatures aboard the ship have advantage on attack rolls, and living creatures aboard the ship have disadvantage on Wisdom saving throws.
- **Ghostly Crew**. If the ship's crew is slain, the Black Pearl can summon a ghostly crew of 20 (use the _Specter_ stat block). These specters can operate the ship and attack enemies but vanish if they leave the ship.
- **Indestructible Legacy**. If the Black Pearl is destroyed, it will fully reassemble itself in 1d4 days unless a _wish_ spell is used to prevent its restoration.

#### **Equipment**

The Black Pearl is outfitted with:

- 20 heavy cannons (10 on each side).
- 1 ballista mounted on the bow.
- 1 mangonel mounted on the stern.
