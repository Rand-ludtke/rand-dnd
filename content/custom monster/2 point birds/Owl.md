**TRAITS**

**All-Knowing.** Wan Shi Tong has advantage on Intelligence (Arcana), Intelligence (History), and Wisdom (Insight) checks. He automatically knows the answer to any question relating to ancient knowledge, forgotten secrets, or hidden truths. He may offer answers at his discretion, but only when he deems them worthy.

**Spirit of the Knowledgeable Owl.** Wan Shi Tong can manipulate the flow of information in the world around him. He can cast _Commune_ and _Legend Lore_ at will, without expending a spell slot, to gather knowledge, but only if it concerns knowledge he deems “important enough.”

**Grumpy Protector of Knowledge.** If a creature tries to remove or destroy knowledge in his library (or in a way he finds disrespectful), Wan Shi Tong immediately becomes hostile, gaining advantage on all attack rolls and saving throws until the end of the combat.

**The Library’s Keeper.** Wan Shi Tong’s physical form is tied to a vast library hidden in the desert. As long as he is near a source of knowledge (books, scrolls, or other written media), he can regain 10 hit points at the start of his turn for every 100 pages of written material within 30 feet of him.

---

**ACTIONS**

**Knowledge Infusion (Recharge 5-6).** Wan Shi Tong imbues a creature within 60 feet of him with ancient knowledge. The creature must succeed on a DC 18 Intelligence saving throw or be stunned for 1 minute, as their mind is overwhelmed with the sheer weight of the knowledge. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success.

**Taloned Strike.** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 18 (2d10 + 3) slashing damage. Wan Shi Tong's talons are as sharp as the sharpest minds, tearing through both flesh and the veil of ignorance.

**Furious Beak.** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 14 (2d6 + 3) piercing damage. Wan Shi Tong's beak strikes with the fury of a thousand scorned scholars.

**Blinding Flash of Wisdom (Recharge 6).** Wan Shi Tong releases a burst of dazzling light from his eyes, blinding and confusing all within 30 feet. Each creature must make a DC 18 Constitution saving throw or be blinded for 1 minute. A blinded creature can make the saving throw at the end of each of its turns to end the blindness early.

---

**LEGENDARY ACTIONS**

Wan Shi Tong can take 2 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time, and only at the end of another creature's turn. Wan Shi Tong regains spent legendary actions at the start of his turn.

**“Shush!”** Wan Shi Tong gives an authoritative “Shush!” to a creature within 30 feet, forcing them to make a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw or be silenced for 1 minute. The creature cannot cast spells with verbal components or speak until the effect ends.

**“Debate the Fool!”** Wan Shi Tong targets one creature within 60 feet of him. The creature must make a DC 18 Intelligence saving throw or take 3d6 psychic damage and be forced to waste their next action arguing with Wan Shi Tong about a piece of knowledge (losing their turn to debate).

**“Knowledge Overload.”** Wan Shi Tong hurls overwhelming amounts of knowledge at a creature within 60 feet. The creature must succeed on a DC 18 Intelligence saving throw or take 4d10 psychic damage and suffer disadvantage on their next attack roll or ability check.

---

**LEGENDARY RESISTANCE (2/Day).** If Wan Shi Tong fails a saving throw, he can choose to succeed instead.

---

**REACTIONS**

**Defensive Knowledge.** When a creature hits Wan Shi Tong with an attack, he can use his reaction to force the attacker to make a DC 18 Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, the attacker takes 2d10 psychic damage as they are overwhelmed with the knowledge that their attack was not as well executed as it could have been.
