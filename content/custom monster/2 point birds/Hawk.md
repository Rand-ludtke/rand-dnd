![[Pasted image 20241211014853.png]]
**Stephen Hawking**
_Medium humanoid (human), neutral good_

**Armor Class** 15 (wheelchair protection)  
**Hit Points** 50 (8d6 + 16)  
**Speed** 15 ft.

**STR** 1 (-5)  
**DEX** 1 (-5)  
**CON** 1 (-5)  
**INT** 30 (+10)  
**WIS** 12 (+1)  
**CHA** 6 (-2)

**Skills** Arcana +15, History +15, Insight +15, Medicine +6, Persuasion +5 (he knows his stuff)  
**Senses** passive Perception 13  
**Languages** Common, Celestial, Draconic, Elvish

**Challenge** 5 (1,800 XP)

**TRAITS**

**Unparalleled Genius.** Stephen can cast _Legend Lore_ at will without using spell slots, as his mind can grasp the deepest truths of the universe. Once per long rest, he can automatically succeed on any Intelligence (Arcana) or Intelligence (History) check.

**Cosmic Insight.** Stephen can predict the outcome of a creature's next attack. As a reaction, when a creature within 30 feet of him makes an attack roll, Stephen can impose disadvantage on the roll, as he knows precisely how things will unfold.

**Mind Over Matter.** Stephen has immunity against being paralyzed(again), stunned, or knocked knocked unconscious.

---

**ACTIONS**

**Charge!!!** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +8 to hit, reach (movement speed in a straight line), one target. _Hit:_ 12 (2d8 + 4) bludgeoning damage. Stephen uses a highly advanced physical maneuver that’s _so complicated_ it’s basically impossible to block(There is a Rocket on the back of his chair), Stephen also takes 1d8 damage and has a 50% chance of falling out of his chair.

**Wormhole (Recharge 5-6).** Stephen opens a small rift in space-time, allowing him to teleport up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space he can see. All creatures within a 10-foot radius must succeed on a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw or take 4d6 force damage as gravitational forces momentarily distort the area.

**Black Hole Theory (1/Day).** Stephen speaks about the infinite density of a black hole with such persuasive power that a creature within 30 feet must make a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or become so entranced by his cosmic explanation that it takes 3d6 psychic damage and becomes incapacitated until the end of Stephen's next turn.

**Quantum Leap (1/Day).** Stephen can manipulate quantum particles around him to create a momentary distortion of reality. As a bonus action, he can make one creature within 30 feet reroll any attack roll, saving throw, or ability check it has just made, forcing it to use the second roll, regardless of whether it is better or worse.

---

**LEGENDARY ACTIONS**

Stephen can take 2 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time, and only at the end of another creature's turn. Stephen regains spent legendary actions at the start of his turn.

**Action 1: “Multiverse Explainer.”** Stephen causes a brief flash of images from parallel universes to appear around him. Each creature within 15 feet of him must make a DC 14 Intelligence saving throw or take 2d6 psychic damage and become confused until the end of its next turn.

**Action 2: “Time Dilation.”** Stephen subtly shifts the flow of time for one creature within 30 feet. The creature must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or become slowed until the end of its next turn.
