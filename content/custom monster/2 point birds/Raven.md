**Whispers of the Mind (Recharge 5-6).** Huginn can whisper secrets into a creature’s mind. One creature within 60 feet that can hear him must make a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by Huginn for 1 minute. While charmed, the creature is compelled to reveal secrets or information it knows, including its plans or weaknesses. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns to end the effect early.

**Feathered Distraction (Recharge 6).** Huginn flaps his wings and creates a blinding cloud of feathers. Each creature within a 10-foot radius must succeed on a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw or be blinded until the end of their next turn. Huginn can fly up to half his speed while doing this.

---

**LEGENDARY ACTIONS**

Huginn can take 2 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time, and only at the end of another creature's turn. Huginn regains spent legendary actions at the start of his turn.

**"Spy's Gaze."** Huginn can observe the surroundings with keen focus. He gains advantage on any Wisdom (Perception) check and can move up to his speed without provoking opportunity attacks.

**"Knowledge Drop."** Huginn whispers a vital piece of information into the mind of one creature within 60 feet. That creature gains advantage on its next attack roll, ability check, or saving throw.

**Taloned Strike.** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 9 (2d4 + 4) slashing damage.

**Memory Drain (Recharge 5-6).** Muninn targets one creature within 60 feet. The creature must succeed on a DC 16 Intelligence saving throw or have its memory of one specific event or detail erased. The target forgets a fact or past event for 1 hour (or longer if the DM deems it necessary). A creature that succeeds on the saving throw suffers disadvantage on their next Intelligence check or saving throw.

**Mind Reading (Recharge 6).** Muninn can read the thoughts of any creature within 30 feet. He can learn surface thoughts and emotions, as well as gain insight into the creature's intentions, motives, and short-term desires. This effect lasts for 1 minute, and the creature can make a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw to end the effect early.

---

**LEGENDARY ACTIONS**
