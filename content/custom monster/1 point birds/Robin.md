**White Dad in a Robin Costume**

_Medium humanoid (human), chaotic good_

**Armor Class** 15 (robe)  
**Hit Points** 44 (8d8 + 8)  
**Speed** 30 ft.

**STR** 10 (+0)  
**DEX** 12 (+1)  
**CON** 14 (+2)

**TRAITS**

**Dad Aura.** The White Dad can channel his parental wisdom to give advantage to any creature within 30 feet on saving throws against fear. However, if a creature fails, the dad feels personally responsible and suffers 3 psychic damage per failure.

**Dad Jokes (Recharge 5-6).** As a bonus action, the White Dad can deliver an excruciatingly bad dad joke. All creatures within 30 feet must succeed on a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw or be stunned for 1 round as they experience overwhelming secondhand embarrassment.

**Dad's Wisdom:** This NPC gives unsolicited life advice to anyone within earshot. Once per day, he can grant an ally within 30 feet a reroll of a failed saving throw.

---

**ACTIONS**

**DAD! Stop! (1/Day).** The White Dad shouts in a voice that echoes like a fatherly rebuke. All creatures within 30 feet must make a DC 14 Charisma saving throw or take 2d6 psychic damage and have disadvantage on their next attack roll. The White Dad heals half the psychic damage dealt.

**He’s the Boss (Psychic Damage).** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 6 (1d6 + 3) psychic damage. The target is reminded that he "is the boss" and must make a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or take disadvantage on their next attack roll.

**What’s That? (Recharge 5-6):** He can give a long, confusing explanation of something irrelevant, forcing all creatures within 10 feet to make a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or become charmed for 1 minute.
