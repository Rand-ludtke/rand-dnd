### **Scaling for Vengeance Points (VP)**

We’ll adjust the **Vengeance Points (VP)** system to ensure the rewards from harder encounters are more impactful, especially for high-difficulty monsters like dragons. Here’s a more granular, adjusted **VP formula**:

**Formula for VP Scaling:**

Vengeance Points=(Enemy’s CR−Player’s Level)×Difficulty Multiplier\text{Vengeance Points} = (\text{Enemy's CR} - \text{Player's Level}) \times \text{Difficulty Multiplier}Vengeance Points=(Enemy’s CR−Player’s Level)×Difficulty Multiplier

### **Difficulty Multiplier**

- **Dragon / Major Boss Fight** (e.g., dragons, liches, archfiends, etc.): **x40**
- **Hard Fight** (e.g., powerful bandit leaders, large groups of elite enemies): **x15**
- **Medium Fight** (e.g., tough but manageable enemies like ogres, minotaurs, etc.): **x5**
- **Semi-Easy Fight** (e.g., basic NPCs, lower CR monsters): **x2**
- **Easy Fight** (e.g., goblins, kobolds, small swarms): **x0**

#### Example Scenarios

- **Dragon (CR 10) vs Level 5 Paladin**
    
    (10−5)×40=200 VP(10 - 5) \times 40 = 200 \text{ VP}(10−5)×40=200 VP
- **Ogre (CR 2) vs Level 5 Paladin**
    
    (2−5)×5=−15 VP(Nopointsearned,butstilladecentfight)(2 - 5) \times 5 = -15 \text{ VP} (No points earned, but still a decent fight)(2−5)×5=−15 VP(Nopointsearned,butstilladecentfight)
- **Goblin (CR 1/4) vs Level 5 Paladin**
    
    (0.25−5)×2=0 VP(0.25 - 5) \times 2 = 0 \text{ VP}(0.25−5)×2=0 VP

## **Prayers to the Sea Angel**

To gain divine blessings, powers, and rewards, the Paladin must **pray near water**. These powers can be physical (swords, armor, etc.) or passive abilities tied to Vengeance Points (VP). Each blessing requires a certain **VP threshold** to unlock, and any loss in VP will cause you to lose the benefits associated with that threshold.

---

## **Vengeance Point Rewards**

Your journey for vengeance unlocks powerful abilities and physical items as you accumulate points. Reaching a threshold grants a new power, and falling below it causes you to lose those powers until you regain the required points.
