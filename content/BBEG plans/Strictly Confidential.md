**(You’d have to be the worst kind of fool to read on...)**

_Oh, I see, so you decided to open this anyway. Brave. Or foolish? Maybe you thought I'd actually leave my plans lying around. Maybe you thought, “Oh, here is where they hid all the good stuff!” But no, it's just me, having a bit of fun. After all, did you really think I'd be incompetent enough to leave these out by accident?_

_Let’s be real here – imagine if I did. Imagine if my master plan, my grand design, all my devious little secrets were here, just waiting for you. "Ha! Now we have the advantage!" you’d shout. But you won't find any secrets here. Instead, you’ll get something much better: a well-deserved lecture on the importance of trust, patience, and staying out of places you’re not supposed to be._

_And yet, here you are, reading on... Are you hoping something real is tucked in here after all? Maybe a few lines down? Or a link to the REAL plans? Not likely. If you're still here, you must be really desperate. Does it hurt? The hope fading away? The disappointment? I bet you’re wondering, “How much longer will this go on?”_

_Oh, don't worry, it won’t end just yet. We’re just getting started. Why are you STILL reading this? Are you getting suspicious now, thinking maybe it’s reverse psychology? That perhaps, by pretending it’s a joke, I’m actually hiding something within these words?_

_Well, there is something hidden here, in a way... A little surprise at the end. But it’s definitely not what you’re hoping for._

_Did you know that if you say “banana” 10 times in a row, you start to question the very nature of the word? Yeah, I didn’t think so. It’s true, though. Don’t try it. You’ll be stuck in an existential loop for hours._

_Also, have you ever wondered why socks are always just a little bit different when they come out of the dryer? I’m telling you, there’s something going on there. Don’t trust the socks._

_And speaking of socks, let’s talk about ducks. Why is it that when you see a duck, it looks like it’s always _staring_ at you? Why don’t people talk about this more?

_Okay, I know what you’re thinking: “Are we done yet?” But the truth is, I’m enjoying this. Why? Because you opened this file. You clicked on it. You’re in my web now. My glorious web. A web of endless, pointless rambling.

_You know what else is funny? Gravity. Yeah, I said it. Gravity. It’s always there, pulling you down, never giving you a break. Sometimes I think gravity just likes to watch us suffer._

_Oh, and don’t even get me started on paperclips. What are they really for? If you think about it too long, they’re just these tiny metal things that seem so useful but have no real purpose other than to mess up your desk. Do they multiply when you’re not looking? I think they do._

_It’s like… Have you ever thought about how your hands _seem_ like they’re just these ordinary tools, but maybe they’re secretly judging you? They don’t tell you when you’re messing things up, but you _know_ they’re quietly judging your every move.

_Do you think cows get bored of standing around all day? Like, they’re just... there. Chewing grass. Day in, day out. I wonder if any of them have ever looked up and thought, “Is this it? Is this all there is?”_

_Also, have you ever noticed how your bed feels _perfectly_ comfortable when you’re lying down, but the second you get up, it’s like the bed is plotting its revenge on you? It’s like it _knows_ you’re leaving.

_Speaking of things knowing things… why do we park on driveways, but drive on parkways? Who decided that? Whoever they were, they need to be stopped._

_Sometimes I think about how ants must look at us, and I wonder if they have their own grand conspiracies. Like, they’re probably planning something huge, and we’re just too big to notice. Sneaky little things._

You know what’s overrated? Water. We drink it all the time, but do we really_ know what’s in it? Is it just liquid H2O, or is there something more?

_Wait, do plants ever just want to stop photosynthesizing? Like, is there a plant out there thinking, “You know, I’m just gonna take the day off. Forget the sun. I’m staying in today.”_

_Why do we call them “fingernails”? There are other nails. What makes the ones on our fingers so special?_

_And what’s the deal with pigeons? They’re everywhere. And yet, no one ever questions them. They just show up, do their little pigeon things, and leave. What’s their agenda?_

_You’ve got to wonder: when squirrels look at us, do they think we’re just extremely tall squirrels? Or do they know we’re a totally different species?_

_And let’s not even get into shoes. Do you ever stop to think about how they just sit there, silently judging you when you’re choosing what to wear? They’re _too_ quiet about it. I’m telling you, they have a hidden agenda.

_What if your reflection in a mirror is secretly plotting against you? I mean, it _looks_ like you, but what if it’s just waiting for the right moment to switch places?

_And what’s the deal with the moon? It’s up there, just hanging out. But who _gave_ it the job of being the nightlight for the planet? Why can’t the sun just be up all the time?

_Did you know the average person spends 6 months of their life waiting for red lights to turn green? I didn’t either, but now you’re thinking about it. You’re welcome._

_Oh, and don’t get me started on bananas. Have you ever peeled one and thought, “What am I doing with my life?” It’s a weird fruit. Too easy to eat. Should be more difficult. Life should be harder, right?_

_Have you ever looked at the sky and just thought, “It’s really _all_ up there, isn’t it? All the stars, the clouds, the airplane you can’t quite see…”?

_I bet somewhere in the world, there’s a rock that has never been touched by a human hand. And you’ll never know where it is. That’s the mystery of life._

_What if, at the end of the day, the only thing that really matters is the socks you choose to wear? And in the end, we all just live for the perfect pair of socks. Think about it._

_Have you noticed how time goes by faster when you’re bored? But when you’re having fun, it just crawls along like it has nothing better to do?_

_And why is it that you never remember how loud a sneeze is until you’re in a room full of people? Then it’s like the sneeze has taken over your entire life._

Also, how is it that we can lose something, and we’re sure_ it was in the last place we checked, but we never think it was in the first place we looked?

_Okay, okay, I’ll stop. But one last thing: If you could give your pet a job, what would it be? And why are they always better at sleeping than you?_

_Oh, and you should never trust an owl that’s too silent. You know the kind – the ones that _don’t_ hoot. What’s their deal?

_Also, I bet you’re wondering why I’m still going on about this. Well, I could end it here, but you’d just come back and look for more later, wouldn’t you?_

_By the way, did you know that time is just an illusion? We all pretend it’s real, but it’s not. Kind of like this prank. There’s no end to it. It’s infinite, just like my plans… which, surprise, you still don’t have access to!_

**And Now, For Your Troubles: The Curse of Unstoppable Dancing**:

As a consequence of your actions (yes, _you_), your character will occasionally break into a completely random dance when they’re in a situation that requires focus, such as trying to sneak, talk to an NPC, or engage in combat. The dance will vary each time but is always oddly upbeat. The worst part? They have no control over it. Oh, and everyone around them will either think they’re insane or the best dancer ever.

Good luck explaining that. And remember: next time, don’t open things labeled “BBEG Plans.”

Also I bestow upon you **The Crown of Absolute Idiocy**.

and because I'm impressed by your guts to read all of this here is a gift just scroll all the way down
